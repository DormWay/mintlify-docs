## Once Approved: Your Labs Dashboard

After approval, "Labs" replaces "Earn" in your sidebar. Your dashboard has three main sections:

### Task Pool

The **Task Pool** shows all available tasks you can claim. Tasks are **first-come, first-served** - when you see one you want, claim it before someone else does!

**Task types include:**
- **Syllabus Uploads** - Upload syllabi from your campus
- **Bug Reports** - Find and report bugs in the app
- **QA Testing** - Test new features
- **Research** - Help with user research

Each task shows:
- What needs to be done
- How much it pays
- The deadline
- How many tasks are available

### My Work

**My Work** shows tasks you've claimed and their status:
- **In Progress** - Tasks you're working on
- **Submitted** - Waiting for review
- **Approved** - Completed and paid
- **Rejected** - Needs revision (you can resubmit)

### Earnings

Track your total earnings, pending payments, and payment history.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Syllabus Browse">
    From the Labs dashboard, click **Syllabus Browse** in the header
  </Step>
  <Step title="Find Missing Syllabi">
    Search for courses at your campus that don't have syllabi yet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload the Syllabus">
    Click **Upload** and select the PDF file
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Course Info">
    Make sure the course name and code are correct

</Steps>

**Where to find syllabi:**
- Your own courses (check your email or course portal)
- Professor websites
- Course catalog pages
- Friends who took the course

<Tip>
  **Quality matters:** Syllabi must be readable, include the grading breakdown, and have the course schedule. Blurry scans or incomplete syllabi may be rejected.
</Tip>

## Unclaiming Tasks

Changed your mind? You can unclaim a task if you haven't submitted it yet:

2. Find the task
3. Click the **Unclaim** button

The task returns to the pool for someone else to claim.

<Warning>
  Don't make a habit of unclaiming tasks - it affects your reliability score and may impact future task eligibility.
</Warning>

## Getting Paid

### How Payments Work

- Payments are processed **weekly** (typically Fridays)
- Approved tasks from the week are batched together
- Payment goes to your connected payment method

### Setting Up Payment

When you join Labs, you'll be asked to set up your payment information. Make sure this is accurate to avoid payment delays.

### Tracking Earnings

Your Labs dashboard shows:
- **Total Earned**: All-time earnings
- **Pending**: Approved tasks waiting for payment
- **This Week**: Tasks completed this week

## Real-Time Updates

The task pool updates in real-time. When someone claims a task, you'll see it disappear from the pool immediately. This means:

- **Act fast** on tasks you want
- **Don't refresh constantly** - updates happen automatically
- The red badge on "Labs" in the sidebar shows new available tasks

# Campus Outreach CRM

The **Campus Outreach CRM** is where Alex tracks ambassador recruitment, campus campaigns, and key contacts at each university. This tool helps you stay organized as you scale outreach across dozens of campuses.

<Tip>
  **For Alex:** This is your primary workspace for daily ambassador recruitment and campaign management. Use it alongside the Growth Scoreboard to track which campuses and tactics are working best.

## Alex's Daily Workflows

### 1. Scout and Recruit Ambassadors

**Goal:** Recruit 1 new ambassador per week (maintain 10-15 active ambassadors total)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Potential Ambassadors">
    Look for high-engagement students at target campuses:
    - Student org leaders (engineering councils, Greek life presidents)
    - Instagram influencers with 1k+ followers
    - Class representatives and RAs
    - Students who've already signed up and are active users
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Contact to CRM">
    Click **Add Contact** in the Contacts tab:
    - **Name**: Full name of the student
    - **Campus**: Select their university from dropdown
    - **Role**: Choose "prospect" or "student_leader"
    - **Instagram Handle**: Their @ handle for outreach
    - **Email** (optional): If you have it
    - **Notes**: Why they're a good fit (e.g., "President of CS Club, 3k followers")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Initial Outreach">
    DM them on Instagram or send email:
    - Introduce DormWay and the ambassador program
    - Explain the $5 per schedule upload referral incentive
    - Ask if they'd be interested in helping grow DormWay on their campus

    Mark contact status as **"contacted"** in the CRM
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Response and Follow Up">
    - If they respond positively → Update status to **"engaged"**
    - If no response after 3 days → Follow up with a different angle
    - If interested → Schedule a quick call to onboard them
  </Step>

  <Step title="Onboard as Ambassador">
    Once they agree:
    - Update status to **"active"**
    - Give them their unique referral code
    - Add them to the ambassador Slack/Discord channel
    - Set next follow-up date (2 weeks out) to check performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Payout Reminder:** Track ambassador referrals in the CRM notes. At the end of each month, calculate payouts ($5 per successful schedule upload) and submit to Riley/Ethan for processing.
</Info>

### 2. Create Campus Outreach Campaigns

**Goal:** Launch targeted campaigns to drive signups at specific campuses

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Campaign Type">
    In the **Activities** tab, click **Create Activity** and select type:
    - **Ambassador Recruitment** - Enroll new ambassadors
    - **Campus-Wide Campaign** - Broad awareness push (Instagram, flyering)
    - **Partnership** - Collaborate with student orgs
    - **Event** - In-person workshops or demo booths
    - **Social Media** - Instagram/TikTok influencer campaigns
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Campaign Details">
    - **Title**: Descriptive name (e.g., "UMass Spring '26 Ambassador Recruitment")
    - **Campus**: Select the target university
    - **Description**: What you're doing and why
    - **Start Date**: When campaign kicks off
    - **End Date**: Campaign deadline
    - **Target Signups**: How many signups you're aiming for
    - **Owner**: Assign to yourself (Alex)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Status to Planned">
    Save the campaign as **"planned"** - this adds it to your campaign list for tracking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Execute Campaign">
    When you start executing:
    - Update status to **"in_progress"**
    - Track signups as they come in (use Growth Scoreboard to see totals by campus)
    - Update **Actual Signups** field as campaign progresses
  </Step>

  <Step title="Complete and Review">
    When campaign ends:
    - Update status to **"completed"**
    - Record final signup count in **Actual Signups**
    - Add learnings to **Notes** (e.g., "Instagram DMs worked better than email")
    - Compare actual vs. target to assess performance
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Campaign:**
```
Title: UMass Amherst Spring '26 Instagram Push
Campus: UMass Amherst
Type: Social Media Campaign
Start Date: Jan 15, 2026
End Date: Feb 15, 2026
Target Signups: 50
Description: Partner with 5 Instagram influencers (1k-5k followers each) to post about DormWay during registration week. Offer exclusive promo code for early adopters.
```

### 3. Manage Contact Follow-Ups

**Goal:** Don't let contacts go cold - stay in touch with prospects and active partners

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Follow-Up Queue">
    In the **Contacts** tab, filter by **"Next Follow-Up Date"** to see who needs outreach today or this week
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Follow-Up">
    For each contact due for follow-up:
    - **Prospects** (never responded): Try a different message angle
    - **Contacted** (no response yet): Send a friendly nudge
    - **Engaged** (in conversation): Schedule next step (call, event invitation)
    - **Active** (ambassadors/partners): Check in on performance, offer support
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Contact Record">
    After each interaction:
    - Add notes about what you discussed
    - Update status if engagement level changed
    - Set new **Next Follow-Up Date** (e.g., 2 weeks out)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Archive Inactive Contacts">
    If a contact hasn't responded after 3-4 follow-ups, update status to **"inactive"** so they don't clutter your active queue
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Don't Skip Follow-Ups:** Most successful partnerships happen after 3-5 touchpoints. Persistence (not spam) is key. Space follow-ups 3-7 days apart.
</Warning>

### 4. Track Campus Coverage

**Goal:** Identify campuses that need more outreach or ambassadors

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review Campaigns by Campus">
    In the **Activities** tab, group campaigns by campus to see which schools have active efforts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Contact Distribution">
    In the **Contacts** tab, group by campus to see where you have the most and fewest contacts
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cross-Reference with Scoreboard">
    Open the [Growth Scoreboard](/docs/growth-ops/scoreboard) and look at WFAU by campus:
    - Campuses with low WFAU but high enrollment = opportunity
    - Campuses with high WFAU but few contacts = need more relationships to sustain growth
  </Step>

  <Step title="Prioritize Gap Campuses">
    Focus ambassador recruitment on:
    - Large schools (5k+ students) with <10 WFAU per week
    - Schools where competitors are strong but you have low presence
    - Campuses with upcoming registration periods (target 2-3 weeks before)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example Priority List:**
| Campus | WFAU Last Week | Active Contacts | Priority Level |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| UMass Amherst | 5 | 2 | **HIGH** (large school, low coverage) |
| UMBC | 35 | 8 | **MEDIUM** (growing well, maintain) |
| Harvard | 2 | 0 | **LOW** (small TAM, tough market) |

---

## Contact Statuses Explained

| Status | What It Means | Your Next Action |
|--------|---------------|------------------|
| **Prospect** | Identified potential contact, not yet reached out | Send initial DM or email |
| **Contacted** | Sent outreach, awaiting response | Follow up in 3-5 days if no reply |
| **Engaged** | Active conversation, interest expressed | Schedule call, share details, close the ask |
| **Active** | Ambassador or partner driving signups | Monthly check-ins, offer support, recognize wins |
| **Inactive** | Previously active but no longer engaging | Try re-engagement or archive to declutter |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Personalize Every Outreach" icon="heart">
    Don't use generic templates. Reference specific campus details, student orgs, or recent events. "Hey Sarah, saw you're president of UMass CS Club..." works way better than "Hi there!"
  </Card>

  <Card title="Track Everything in Notes" icon="pencil">
    After every interaction, log what you discussed, what you promised, and what they said. Future-you will thank you when you follow up 2 weeks later.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Set Realistic Targets" icon="bullseye">
    Signup targets should be 1-5% of campus enrollment for broad campaigns. Example: UMass (22k students) → target 50-200 signups for a major campaign.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Follow Up Consistently" icon="calendar-check">
    Most partnerships happen after 3-5 touchpoints. Space them 3-7 days apart. Don't give up after first message, but also don't spam daily.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Contact Won't Respond" icon="ghost">
    **Issue:** Sent 2-3 messages, no reply

    **Strategies:**
    - Try different platform (Instagram → Email or vice versa)
    - Change your angle (focus on different benefit)
    - Reference recent campus event or news to show you're paying attention
    - Offer something valuable (free premium feature, exclusive access)

    If still no response after 4 attempts, mark as **"inactive"** and move on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't Find Good Prospects on Campus" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Issue:** Don't know who to reach out to at a new campus

    **Research tactics:**
    - Search Instagram hashtags: `#[campusname]`, `#[campusname]students`
    - Browse student org directories on campus website
    - Check Facebook groups for the campus
    - Look at existing DormWay users from that campus (ask Riley/Ethan for list)
    - Search LinkedIn for recent grads who might still have connections
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Campaign Underperforming" icon="chart-line-down">
    **Issue:** Actual signups way below target

    **Diagnostic questions:**
    - Is messaging resonating? (Test different value props)
    - Is timing right? (Registration week vs. mid-semester)
    - Is reach sufficient? (Maybe you need more ambassadors/influencers)
    - Is product experience good? (Check Day 7 return rate for this campus)

    **Action:** Add learnings to campaign notes, adjust tactics for next campaign
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Many Contacts to Manage" icon="users-slash">
    **Issue:** Follow-up queue is overwhelming

    **Triage strategies:**
    - Prioritize **engaged** and **active** contacts (highest ROI)
    - Batch-update **contacted** prospects who never responded to **inactive**
    - Set longer follow-up intervals (2 weeks instead of 3 days) for low-priority contacts
    - Focus on 3-5 high-potential campuses rather than spreading thin across 20
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

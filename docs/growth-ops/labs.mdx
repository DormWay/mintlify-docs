    B --> C[submitted]
    C --> D[completed]
    D --> E[paid]
    A --> F[cancelled]

  <Step title="Assigned">
    Admin creates task and assigns to Labs member. Member receives notification.
  </Step>

  <Step title="In Progress">
    Member marks task as `in_progress` when they start working.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submitted">
    Member uploads deliverable URL and marks task `submitted`.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Completed">
    Admin reviews deliverable and marks task `completed`. Updates `completed_at` timestamp.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Paid">
    After payment is processed (Venmo, Zelle, etc.), admin marks task `paid` with `paid_at` timestamp.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Cancelled (Optional)">

## Analytics & Reporting

### Weekly Performance Metrics

<Info>
  **Coming Soon**: Analytics dashboard with charts and leaderboards. See [GROWTH_OPS_ANALYTICS_PLAN.md](https://github.com/DormWay/dormway-platform/blob/main/GROWTH_OPS_ANALYTICS_PLAN.md).
</Info>

| Metric | Description | Query |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Tasks Completed** | Tasks marked complete this week | `COUNT(*) WHERE completed_at >= week_start` |
| **Total Payouts** | Sum of completed task payouts | `SUM(payout_cents) WHERE status IN ('completed', 'paid')` |
| **Avg Completion Time** | Hours from assignment to completion | `AVG(completed_at - created_at)` |
| **Active Members** | Members with tasks this week | `COUNT(DISTINCT labs_member_id) WHERE week_start = current_week` |

### Member Performance Leaderboard

```sql
SELECT
  glm.id,
  a.given_name || ' ' || a.family_name as name,
  COUNT(glt.id) as tasks_completed,
  SUM(glt.payout_cents) / 100.0 as total_earnings,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (glt.completed_at - glt.created_at)) / 3600) as avg_hours_per_task
FROM growth_labs_members glm
LEFT JOIN accounts a ON a.id = glm.account_id
LEFT JOIN growth_labs_tasks glt ON glt.labs_member_id = glm.id AND glt.status IN ('completed', 'paid')
WHERE glm.status = 'active'
GROUP BY glm.id, a.given_name, a.family_name
ORDER BY tasks_completed DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

**Example Output**:
| Rank | Name | Tasks Completed | Total Earnings | Avg Hours/Task |
|------|------|-----------------|----------------|----------------|
| 🥇 | Sarah Chen | 45 | $675.00 | 2.3 |
| 🥈 | Miguel Rodriguez | 38 | $570.00 | 2.8 |
| 🥉 | Emily Park | 32 | $480.00 | 2.1 |

## Payout Management

### Payment Workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Weekly Payout Report">
    Generate report of all completed tasks awaiting payment.

    ```sql
    SELECT
      glm.id as member_id,
      a.given_name || ' ' || a.family_name as member_name,
      a.email,
      COUNT(glt.id) as tasks,
      SUM(glt.payout_cents) / 100.0 as total_owed
    FROM growth_labs_tasks glt
    JOIN growth_labs_members glm ON glm.id = glt.labs_member_id
    JOIN accounts a ON a.id = glm.account_id
    WHERE glt.status = 'completed' AND glt.paid_at IS NULL
    GROUP BY glm.id, a.given_name, a.family_name, a.email
    ORDER BY total_owed DESC;
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Process Payments">
    Send payments via Venmo, Zelle, or PayPal. Record transaction IDs in metadata.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Mark as Paid">
    Update tasks to `paid` status with `paid_at` timestamp.

    ```sql
    UPDATE growth_labs_tasks
    SET
      status = 'paid',
      paid_at = NOW(),
      metadata = metadata || '{"payment_method": "venmo", "transaction_id": "xyz123"}'::jsonb
    WHERE status = 'completed'
      AND paid_at IS NULL
      AND labs_member_id = 'member-uuid';
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Member Total Earnings">
    Recalculate `total_earnings_cents` for each member.

    ```sql
    UPDATE growth_labs_members
    SET total_earnings_cents = (
      SELECT SUM(payout_cents)
      FROM growth_labs_tasks
      WHERE labs_member_id = growth_labs_members.id
        AND status = 'paid'
    )
    WHERE id = 'member-uuid';
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payment Methods

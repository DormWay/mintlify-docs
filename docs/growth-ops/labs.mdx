# Labs Admin Dashboard

The **Labs Admin Dashboard** is where you manage the DormWay Labs program. This includes reviewing applications, creating tasks for the pool, approving submissions, and tracking member performance.

<Info>
  **New in 2026:** Labs now uses a **self-service task pool model**. Students apply to join, browse available tasks, and claim them first-come-first-served. This replaces the old manual assignment model.
</Info>

  <Step title="Go to Admin Dashboard">
    Navigate to `https://admin.dormway.app` and sign in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Growth Section">
    Click **Growth** in the sidebar, then **Labs**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Your Tab">

</Steps>

## Daily Workflows

### 1. Review Applications

New applications appear in the **Applications** tab. Review them daily to keep the pipeline moving.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Pending Applications">
    Filter by **Status: Pending** to see applications awaiting review
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Application Details">
    Check:
    - **Motivation**: Why do they want to join?
    - **Social Reach**: How connected are they on campus?
    - **Campus**: Are they from a campus we're targeting?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Approve or Reject">
    - **Approve**: Click **Approve** to add them as an active member
    - **Reject**: Click **Reject** and provide a reason (they can reapply later)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Approval criteria:**
- Clear motivation to help improve DormWay
- From an active campus (or campus we want to expand to)
- No red flags in application

<Tip>
  **Be generous with approvals** - the task pool model is self-regulating. Poor performers naturally do fewer tasks and earn less.
</Tip>

# Labs Dashboard

The **Labs Dashboard** is where Lauren manages the DormWay Labs program - W2 employees ($20/hr) who help with QA testing, syllabus gathering, and other growth tasks. This tool tracks task assignments, deliverables, and member performance.

<Tip>
  **For Lauren:** This is your primary workspace for managing Labs members and coordinating their work. Payroll is handled separately in Gusto - this dashboard is for task management and performance tracking only.
</Tip>

### 2. Create and Assign Tasks

**Goal:** Assign 15-20 tasks per week to Labs members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Task Type">
    In the **Tasks** tab, click **Create Task** and select type:
    - **Syllabus Gathering** - Collect course syllabi from specific campuses
    - **QA Testing** - Test new features before release
    - **Bug Hunting** - Find and document bugs in iOS/web app

  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Task Details">
    - **Title**: Clear, descriptive name (e.g., "Gather 10 STEM syllabi from UConn")
    - **Description**: Detailed instructions with examples
      - What specifically needs to be done
      - Where to find the information
      - How to format deliverables
      - Quality standards expected
    - **Assigned To**: Select Labs member from dropdown
    - **Expected Hours**: Estimate how long it should take
    - **Deadline**: When you need it completed by
    - **Week**: Assign to current or next week for tracking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Expectations">
    The clearer your instructions, the better the deliverable. Include:
    - Examples of good vs. bad deliverables
    - Links to resources they'll need
    - Who to contact if they have questions
    - Any special requirements or constraints
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save and Notify">
    Save the task - the Labs member will see it in their task queue (if mobile view is built) or you can email them directly

### 3. Review Deliverables

**Goal:** Quality check completed work and approve tasks (daily)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Submitted Tasks">
    In the **Tasks** tab, filter by **Status: Submitted** to see tasks awaiting review
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Deliverable">
    Click the deliverable link (Google Drive, Notion, etc.) to review the work
  </Step>

  <Step title="Quality Check">
    Verify the deliverable meets task requirements:
    - **Syllabus tasks:** PDFs are readable, metadata is complete, no duplicates
    - **QA tasks:** Test results are thorough, bugs are well-documented
    - **Bug reports:** Reproduction steps are clear, screenshots included

    Check against the quality standards you specified in the task description
  </Step>

  <Step title="Approve or Request Revisions">
    If work is good:
    - Mark task as **"Completed"**
    - Add thank you note in comments
    - Task hours count toward their Gusto timesheet

    If work needs improvement:
    - Add specific feedback in task notes (what's missing, what needs fixing)
    - Change status to **"In Progress"** or keep as **"Submitted"**
    - Set new deadline for revisions
    - Notify member via Slack or email
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track in Gusto">
    Labs members track their hours in Gusto separately. Completed tasks in the dashboard are just for your reference - they handle their own timesheets.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Don't approve low-quality work** - it sets a bad precedent. Give clear, constructive feedback and request revisions. Most members will improve quickly with good guidance.
</Warning>

---

### 4. Monitor Performance

**Goal:** Track which Labs members are most productive and responsive

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Task Completion Rates">
    In the **Members** tab, view each member's stats:
    - Tasks completed this week
    - Tasks completed all-time
    - Average completion time
    - Tasks currently assigned
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Top Performers">
    Look for members with:
    - High completion rates (completing tasks on time)
    - Low revision requests (getting it right the first time)
    - Quick turnaround (finishing before deadline)

    These are your go-to members for high-priority tasks
  </Step>

  <Step title="Flag Low Performers">
    Watch for members with:
    - Missed deadlines (tasks overdue for 3+ days)
    - Frequent revision requests (quality issues)
    - Low task volume (not taking on enough work)

    Check in with them to understand blockers - maybe they need clearer instructions or have availability issues
  </Step>

  <Step title="Adjust Assignments">
    - Give more complex/important tasks to top performers
    - Give simpler tasks to new or struggling members
    - Reduce assignment volume for members who are overwhelmed
    - Consider offboarding members who consistently underperform
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Performance Tiers:**
| Tier | Characteristics | Assignment Strategy |
|------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Top Performer** | 90%+ on-time completion, high quality | Priority tasks, higher volume (5-8 tasks/week) |
| **Solid Contributor** | 70-89% completion, occasional revisions | Standard tasks, medium volume (3-5 tasks/week) |
| **Needs Improvement** | <70% completion, frequent revisions | Simple tasks, lower volume (1-2 tasks/week), coaching |
| **At Risk** | Missed multiple deadlines, quality issues | Performance improvement plan, consider offboarding |

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Set Clear Expectations" icon="bullseye">
    Spend extra time writing detailed task descriptions. Include examples, links, quality criteria. 10 minutes upfront saves hours of back-and-forth.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Batch Assign Tasks" icon="layer-group">
    Assign all weekly tasks on Tuesday, not one-by-one throughout the week. Labs members can plan their time better when they see the full week ahead.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Give Constructive Feedback" icon="comments">
    When requesting revisions, explain specifically what's wrong and how to fix it. "This is great! Could you also add X?" is better than "This needs work."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Recognize Good Work" icon="star">
    Thank members for quality deliverables, call out top performers in team updates. Recognition motivates more than payment alone.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Member Missed Deadline" icon="clock">
    **Issue:** Task is overdue by 2+ days, no communication from member

    **Steps:**
    1. DM them on Slack: "Hey [Name], checking in on [Task Name] - do you need any help or more time?"
    2. If no response in 24 hours, reassign task to another member
    3. Follow up 1-on-1 to understand what happened (sick? Exams? Didn't understand task?)
    4. Adjust future assignments based on their bandwidth

    **When to escalate:** If member misses 3+ deadlines without communication, discuss with Riley/Ethan about offboarding
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Deliverable Quality is Poor" icon="thumbs-down">
    **Issue:** Member submitted work but it doesn't meet standards

    **First time:**
    - Assume they didn't understand expectations
    - Give detailed feedback on what's wrong
    - Request revision with clear guidance
    - Extend deadline if needed

    **Second time (same member):**
    - Check if your instructions were clear enough
    - Schedule 1-on-1 call to explain expectations
    - Consider assigning simpler tasks until quality improves

    **Third time:**
    - Performance improvement plan: "You need to hit X quality on next 3 tasks or we'll need to part ways"
    - If no improvement, offboard and find replacement
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Too Much Work, Not Enough Labs Members" icon="users-slash">
    **Issue:** You have 30 tasks to assign but only capacity for 15

    **Short-term:**
    - Prioritize ruthlessly (what MUST get done vs. nice-to-have)
    - Assign higher task volume to top performers
    - Defer non-urgent tasks to next week

    **Long-term:**
    - Request budget from Riley/Ethan to hire more Labs members
    - Train current members to work faster with better task descriptions
    - Automate repetitive tasks (e.g., syllabus gathering scripts)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Member Wants More Hours" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    **Issue:** Labs member asks for more tasks because they want more hours

    **Response:**
    - Check their current performance (are they completing assigned tasks well?)
    - If top performer: Increase their weekly task volume
    - If average/struggling: Keep volume the same until quality improves
    - Be honest: "I want to give you more, but I need to see consistent quality on your current workload first"

    **Note:** Coordinate with Riley/Ethan on Gusto hours budget - make sure there's budget for increased hours before assigning more tasks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Coordinating with Alex

Lauren and Alex collaborate on campus priorities:

### Syllabus Gathering Strategy

**How it works:**
1. Alex identifies high-priority campuses (large schools with low WFAU, upcoming registration periods)
2. Lauren assigns Labs members to gather syllabi from those campuses
3. More syllabus coverage → better schedule recommendations → higher WFAU
4. Track impact in Growth Scoreboard (does WFAU increase at campuses after syllabus push?)

**Example:**
- Alex sees in Scoreboard that UConn has only 10 WFAU/week but 15k students (big opportunity)
- Alex tells Lauren: "UConn registration is in 2 weeks, can we prioritize UConn syllabi?"
- Lauren assigns 3 Labs members to gather 50 UConn syllabi this week
- Following week, Alex creates UConn outreach campaign
- Result: UConn WFAU jumps from 10 → 40

---

### QA Testing Before Campaigns

**How it works:**
1. Alex plans major campus campaign for next week
2. Lauren assigns Labs members to QA test the onboarding flow
3. Labs members find and report bugs
4. Bugs get fixed before campaign launches
5. Campaign has higher conversion (fewer users hit bugs during sign-up)

**Example:**
- Alex: "Launching big UMass campaign Monday, expecting 100+ signups"
- Lauren: "Let me have Labs members test the schedule upload flow this week to catch any bugs"
- Labs member finds bug in iOS schedule screenshot parser
- Bug gets fixed Friday
- Campaign launches Monday with smooth onboarding → higher Day 7 return rate

---

## Member Offboarding

When a Labs member needs to be offboarded (performance issues, graduation, etc.):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Coordinate with Riley/Ethan">
    Discuss offboarding decision - get approval before taking action
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reassign Active Tasks">
    Move any in-progress or assigned tasks to other Labs members
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Member Status">
    In the **Members** tab, change their status to **"Inactive"** or **"Alumni"**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Remove from Gusto">
    Riley/Ethan handle Gusto offboarding (final paycheck, benefits termination, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send Offboarding Email">
    Thank them for their contributions, provide any necessary next steps (returning equipment, etc.)
  </Step>
</Steps>

# Bug Reports

The **Bug Reports** tool shows all bugs that students report directly from the mobile app or web application. Both Alex and Lauren help triage these reports, prioritizing critical issues and forwarding bugs to engineering via Linear.

<Tip>
  **Quick triage workflow:** Check Bug Reports dashboard → Assign severity → Forward critical/high bugs to Linear → Mark as triaged. Do this daily to catch breaking issues fast.
</Tip>

## Accessing Bug Reports

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Admin Dashboard">
    Navigate to `https://admin.dormway.app` and sign in
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open Growth Section">
    Click **Growth** in the sidebar, then **Bug Reports**
  </Step>
  <Step title="View New Reports">
    Filter by **Status: Submitted** to see bugs that need triage
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Daily Triage Workflow

**Goal:** Catch and escalate critical bugs within hours, prevent user frustration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check for New Reports">
    First thing each morning, open Bug Reports and filter by **"Submitted"** status
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read Bug Description">
    For each new bug:
    - Read the title and description carefully
    - View the screenshot if provided (click to open)
    - Check platform (iOS, Web, Android)
    - Note how many users have reported the same issue
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign Severity">
    Choose the severity level based on impact (see severity guide below):
    - **Critical** - App crash, login broken, data loss
    - **High** - Major feature broken, significant UX problem
    - **Medium** - Feature partially broken, workarounds exist
    - **Low** - Cosmetic issue, minor edge case
  </Step>

  <Step title="Forward to Linear (if needed)">
    For **Critical** and **High** severity bugs:
    - Click **"Send to Linear"** button
    - This creates an issue in Linear for the engineering team
    - Linear issue ID will appear in the bug report for tracking
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update Status to Triaged">
    Change status from **"Submitted"** to **"Triaged"**
    - This moves it out of the triage queue
    - Bug now shows up in engineering's view
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Internal Notes (optional)">
    If you have additional context:
    - Add notes about reproduction steps you tested
    - Mention if this is affecting many users
    - Link related bugs if this is a duplicate
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Severity Levels Guide

### Critical (Same-day response)

**What it means:** App is broken for most/all users, or users are losing data

**Examples:**
- App crashes on launch (all users affected)
- Can't log in (blocks access to entire app)
- Schedule deleted after update (data loss)
- Security issue (user data exposed)

**Action:** Forward to Linear immediately, notify Riley/Ethan via Slack

---

### High (1-2 day response)

**What it means:** Major feature isn't working, significant UX degradation

**Examples:**
- Calendar sync fails (common feature, no workaround)
- Syllabus upload doesn't save (blocks onboarding)
- Dashboard shows wrong GPA (misleading data)
- Assignment reminders not sending (core value prop broken)

**Action:** Forward to Linear, prioritize in next sprint

---

### Medium (3-5 day response)

**What it means:** Feature partially broken, workarounds exist, or minor UX issue

**Examples:**
- UI rendering glitch on specific screen
- Slow load time on one page
- Missing error message when upload fails
- Filter doesn't remember last selection

**Action:** Add to Linear backlog, fix when bandwidth allows

---

### Low (Backlog)

**What it means:** Cosmetic issue, rare edge case, doesn't impact core functionality

**Examples:**
- Typo in button text
- Color mismatch in dark mode
- Minor spacing inconsistency
- Broken link in help docs

**Action:** Add to backlog, batch fix with other low-priority items

---

## When to Forward to Linear

**Forward immediately:**
- ✅ Critical severity (always)
- ✅ High severity (always)
- ✅ Medium severity affecting many users (check if duplicate reports exist)

**Don't forward (handle in admin dashboard):**
- ❌ Low severity cosmetic issues (batch these monthly)
- ❌ Duplicate reports (link to existing Linear issue instead)
- ❌ Not actually bugs (feature requests, user confusion)

<Info>
  **Engineering bandwidth:** Riley and Ethan work on critical/high bugs first. Don't forward every medium/low bug - prioritize the ones that actually hurt user experience.
</Info>

## Common Bug Triage Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Bug is Actually a Feature Request" icon="lightbulb">
    **Example:** "Add dark mode to calendar view"

    **What to do:**
    - Change status to **"Won't Fix"** (not a bug)
    - Add note: "This is a feature request, not a bug - moved to feature backlog"
    - Don't forward to Linear (or forward as feature request, not bug)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Duplicate Bug Report" icon="copy">
    **Example:** 5 students report "Can't upload schedule on iOS"

    **What to do:**
    - Forward the first report to Linear
    - Mark duplicates as **"Triaged"** with note: "Duplicate of Linear issue #123"
    - Mention in Linear issue that it's affecting multiple users
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't Reproduce the Bug" icon="question">
    **Example:** "Schedule disappeared" but you can't replicate it

    **What to do:**
    - Add note asking for more details: "Can you provide steps to reproduce?"
    - If student responds with clear steps → Forward to Linear
    - If no response after 3 days → Mark as **"Won't Fix"** with note: "Unable to reproduce"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bug Already Fixed" icon="check">
    **Example:** Student reports bug from old app version that was fixed last week

    **What to do:**
    - Check app version in bug metadata
    - If old version: Mark as **"Resolved"** with note: "Fixed in version X.Y.Z"
    - Optionally message student to update their app
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bug Affects Specific Campus/Course" icon="building">
    **Example:** "UMass CS101 syllabus won't load"

    **What to do:**
    - Add severity based on impact (1 course = Medium, all courses at campus = High)
    - In notes, specify affected campus/course
    - Forward to Linear with context so engineering can debug specific data
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tracking Bug Resolution

### After Forwarding to Linear

1. **Linear issue gets created** - You'll see the Linear ID appear in the bug report
2. **Engineering investigates** - They work on the fix based on priority
3. **Fix gets deployed** - Bug moves to "Resolved" status
4. **Auto-close after 7 days** - If no new reports, bug closes automatically

### Checking Bug Status

- **In Bug Reports dashboard:** See current status (Triaged, Assigned, In Progress, Resolved)
- **In Linear:** Click Linear ID link to see engineering notes and progress
- **In Growth Scoreboard:** Track bug fix impact on retention (did Day 7 return improve after critical bug fix?)

---

## Weekly Bug Review (Optional)

**Goal:** Catch patterns and prioritize high-impact fixes

Every Monday or Friday:

1. **Review bug volume by platform**
   - If iOS has 20 bugs but Web only has 5 → iOS needs attention
   - Mention in weekly sync with Riley/Ethan

2. **Identify repeat issues**
   - Same bug reported by 5+ users → escalate priority
   - Multiple bugs in same feature → that feature needs QA overhaul

3. **Check average resolution time**
   - Critical bugs should resolve in <1 day
   - High bugs should resolve in 1-2 days
   - If resolution is slow, flag to Riley/Ethan (maybe engineering is overloaded)

4. **Close resolved bugs**
   - Review bugs in "Resolved" status for 7+ days
   - If no new reports, mark as **"Closed"**
   - Keeps the active queue clean

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Triage Daily" icon="calendar-check">
    Check Bug Reports every morning (takes 5-10 min). Catching critical bugs early prevents user churn and bad reviews.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Be Specific in Notes" icon="note-sticky">
    When forwarding to Linear, add context: "Affects all iOS users on version 1.2.3" is better than "Schedule broken."
  </Card>

  <Card title="Don't Over-Forward" icon="filter">
    Not every bug needs to go to Linear immediately. Low/medium bugs can be batched weekly unless they're affecting many users.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Link Related Bugs" icon="link">
    If you see similar bugs, link them in notes. Helps engineering see patterns and fix root cause instead of symptoms.
  </Card>

## Coordinating Bug Fixes with Campaigns

### Before Major Campaigns

**Why it matters:** If you're launching a big campus campaign expecting 100+ signups, you want the app to be bug-free.

**Workflow with Lauren:**
1. Alex plans major UMass campaign for next Monday
2. Lauren assigns Labs members to QA test onboarding flow this week
3. Labs members find and report bugs via Bug Reports tool
4. You triage and forward bugs to Linear
5. Engineering fixes bugs before campaign launches
6. Campaign has smoother onboarding → higher Day 7 return

**Example:**
- Week 1: Alex tells Lauren "Big UConn push next week"
- Week 1: Lauren has Labs test schedule upload, canvas sync, dashboard
- Week 1: Labs find 3 bugs, you forward to Linear as High severity
- Week 1: Engineering fixes all 3 bugs by Friday
- Week 2: Campaign launches, no bugs hit new users
- Week 2: UConn Day 7 return is 45% instead of usual 30%

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too Many Bug Reports to Triage" icon="inbox-full">
    **Issue:** 50+ untr iaged bugs in the queue, feeling overwhelmed

    **Quick triage:**
    1. Sort by severity (if already assigned) - triage Critical/High first
    2. Sort by date - newest bugs first (older bugs may already be fixed)
    3. Batch similar bugs - if 10 bugs are about the same issue, forward one to Linear and mark others as duplicates
    4. Defer low severity - mark cosmetic bugs as "Triaged" without forwarding, batch fix later

    **Long-term:** Talk to Riley/Ethan about automating duplicate detection or adding a Labs member to help with triage
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Student Didn't Provide Enough Info" icon="info">
    **Issue:** Bug report says "App is broken" with no details

    **Steps:**
    1. Add note requesting more info: "Can you describe what you were trying to do and what happened?"
    2. Leave status as "Submitted" (waiting for response)
    3. If no response in 3 days → Mark as "Won't Fix" with note: "Insufficient information to reproduce"

    **Prevention:** If you see this often, suggest adding required fields to bug report form (what were you doing, what did you expect, what actually happened)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Bug Still Not Fixed After 2 Weeks" icon="clock">
    **Issue:** Forwarded High severity bug to Linear 2 weeks ago, still not resolved

    **Steps:**
    1. Check Linear issue - see if engineering has updates or blockers
    2. If blocked: See if you can help (provide more context, test case, affected users)
    3. If stalled: Bring up in weekly sync with Riley/Ethan - might need re-prioritization

    **Note:** Engineering has bandwidth constraints. Sometimes High bugs get deprioritized if new Critical bugs come in.

## System Architecture

### Tech Stack

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Backend (api-router)" icon="server">
    - **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
    - **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with Row-Level Security (RLS)
    - **Auth**: Role-based access control (`admin`, `growth_ops` roles)
    - **Real-time**: Ably pub/sub for live updates
    - **Files**: S3 integration for screenshots and deliverables
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Frontend (dormway-admin)" icon="desktop">
    - **Framework**: React + Vite
    - **UI Library**: Refine v4 + Material-UI (MUI)
    - **Auth**: Clerk with RBAC
    - **Data Grid**: MUI X DataGrid with pagination, sorting, filtering
    - **Charts**: Recharts (planned for analytics dashboards)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Database Schema" icon="database">
    - `growth_bug_reports` - Bug tracking with severity, status, screenshots
    - `growth_labs_members` - Labs program members and their status
    - `growth_labs_tasks` - Task assignments with payouts and deliverables
    - `campus_outreach` - Campus outreach activities and campaigns
    - `campus_outreach_contacts` - Contact management for campus leads
    - `growth_scoreboard` - Pre-computed weekly growth metrics
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Security Model

All Growth Ops tables use **PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)** with role-based policies:

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **admin** | Full access to all Growth Ops features (read/write/delete) |
| **growth_ops** | Read-only access to analytics, limited write access to tasks |
| **Labs members** | Can view own tasks, update status, submit deliverables |
| **Authenticated users** | Can submit bug reports, view own reports |

<Tip>
  **Development Tip**: Use `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` in local dev to bypass RLS policies. Production uses `DATABASE_URL` with RLS enabled.
</Tip>

## Quick Start

### Accessing Growth Ops Tools

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login to Admin Dashboard">
    Navigate to `https://admin.dormway.app` and sign in with your Clerk admin account
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Role">
    Ensure your account has `admin` or `growth_ops` role assigned in Clerk
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Growth Section">
    Find the **Growth** menu in the sidebar with these sections:
    - Labs Dashboard
    - Scoreboard
    - Bug Reports
    - Campus Outreach
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Start all services
cd dormway-platform
make dev

# Access admin dashboard
open http://localhost:3004

# Access API directly
curl http://localhost:3001/api/admin/growth/bug-reports \
  -H "X-User-Role: admin"
```

<Warning>
  **Important**: The admin dashboard (`dormway-admin`) uses **Clerk** for authentication, NOT Auth0. Some legacy docs may reference Auth0 - those are outdated.
</Warning>

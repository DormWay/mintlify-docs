# Growth Scoreboard

The **Growth Scoreboard** is your weekly metrics dashboard showing user acquisition, retention, and performance by source. Both Alex and Lauren review this every **Friday** to track progress toward WFAU goals and identify high-performing channels.

<Tip>
  **WFAU (Weekly First-Action Users)** is your North Star metric - students who completed onboarding (uploaded schedule or connected Canvas) in the past 7 days.
</Tip>

## Understanding the Metrics

### Key Metrics Explained

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="WFAU (Weekly First-Action Users)" icon="users">
    **What it is:** Number of students who completed onboarding this week

    **What counts as "first action":**
    - Uploaded their schedule (manual or via screenshot)
    - Connected Canvas account
    - Connected Google Calendar

    **Why it matters:** This is your primary growth metric - it shows how many new students actually started using DormWay (not just signed up).

    **Goal:** Track week-over-week growth and identify which sources drive the most first-action users.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Day 7 Return Rate (%)" icon="rotate">
    **What it is:** Percentage of users who return to the app within 7 days of first action

    **Why it matters:** Shows retention quality - a high Day 7 return means users find value and stick around.

    **Good benchmark:**
    - 40%+ = Excellent (users are highly engaged)
    - 25-40% = Good (typical for early-stage apps)
    - <25% = Needs improvement (users aren't finding value)

    **How to improve it:** Lauren optimizes lifecycle emails (welcome series, nudges) to bring users back.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metrics by Source" icon="filter">
    **What it shows:** WFAU and Day 7 return broken down by acquisition channel

    **Common sources:**
    - `ambassador_referral` - Students referred by campus ambassadors
    - `campus_outreach` - Direct outreach campaigns
    - `organic` - Word of mouth, social media
    - `paid` - Paid advertising (if running)

    **Why it matters:** Identifies which channels bring the highest quality users (not just the most users).

    **Example:** If `ambassador_referral` has 50 WFAU with 45% Day 7 return, but `organic` has 100 WFAU with 20% Day 7 return, ambassadors are bringing higher quality users even though organic has more volume.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Metrics by Campus" icon="building-columns">
    **What it shows:** Performance broken down by university

    **Why it matters:**
    - Alex uses this to identify which campuses need more ambassador coverage
    - Shows which campuses have the best engagement (use as case studies for new campuses)
    - Helps prioritize where to focus outreach efforts

    **Example:** If UMass Amherst has 80 WFAU but UMBC only has 5, Alex might recruit more ambassadors at UMBC or try different outreach tactics.

## Weekly Scoreboard Workflow

### Friday Review (Both Alex and Lauren)

Every Friday, update the team's master scoreboard with the week's performance:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Current Week View">
    The scoreboard defaults to the current week (Monday-Sunday)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Total WFAU">
    - Check total WFAU for the week
    - Compare to previous week and growth goals
    - Note if you hit, exceeded, or missed the target
  </Step>

  <Step title="Check Day 7 Return Rate">
    - Look at overall retention percentage
    - Compare to previous weeks - is it improving or declining?
    - Note any significant changes (e.g., 35% → 42% jump means something worked well)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze by Source">
    - See which acquisition channels drove the most WFAU
    - Check Day 7 return for each source to assess quality
    - Identify best performing sources to double down on
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze by Campus">
    - Review which campuses had the most new users
    - Check if any campuses are underperforming
    - Note campuses with high engagement (potential case studies)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export Key Numbers">
    Copy metrics to the team's shared scoreboard (Google Sheet or Notion):
    - Total WFAU this week
    - Day 7 return %
    - Top 3 sources by volume
    - Top 3 campuses by WFAU
    - Week-over-week growth %
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Metrics update overnight** - If you check the scoreboard on Friday morning and the numbers look low, they might not be fully updated yet. Check again Friday afternoon or Saturday morning for accurate weekly totals.
</Info>

## How Alex Uses the Scoreboard

### 1. Identify Ambassador Performance

**Goal:** See which ambassadors are driving the most referrals

**Steps:**
1. Filter by source: `ambassador_referral`
2. Break down by campus to see which ambassadors are most active
3. Note ambassadors who haven't had any referrals recently (may need re-engagement)
4. Use this data to calculate monthly payouts ($5 per successful referral)

**Action items:**
- Thank and recognize top-performing ambassadors
- Reach out to inactive ambassadors to re-engage them
- Share success stories with new ambassadors as examples

---

### 2. Find Campus Coverage Gaps

**Goal:** Identify campuses that need more outreach or ambassadors

**Steps:**
1. Look at "Metrics by Campus" section
2. Sort by WFAU (ascending) to see campuses with lowest activity
3. Cross-reference with campus size - large campuses with low WFAU are gaps
4. Check if you have active ambassadors at those campuses

**Action items:**
- Prioritize ambassador recruitment at low-activity campuses
- Create targeted outreach campaigns for underperforming campuses
- Consider different tactics (partnerships, clubs, events) if ambassadors aren't working

---

### 3. Evaluate Campaign Effectiveness

**Goal:** Measure ROI of campus outreach campaigns

**Steps:**
1. Note WFAU from `campus_outreach` source this week
2. Compare to previous weeks to see if recent campaigns are working
3. Look at Day 7 return for outreach users vs. other sources
4. Cross-reference with campaigns you launched recently

**Example:** If you launched a UMass Instagram campaign 2 weeks ago and UMass WFAU jumped from 10 → 35 this week, that campaign is working.

**Action items:**
- Double down on successful campaign tactics
- Replicate winning campaigns at other campuses
- Stop or adjust campaigns that aren't driving WFAU

---

## How Lauren Uses the Scoreboard

### 1. Monitor Lifecycle Email Impact

**Goal:** See if lifecycle emails are improving Day 7 return rate

**Steps:**
1. Check overall Day 7 return % this week
2. Compare to previous 4 weeks - is there an upward trend?
3. Note if you launched new email campaigns recently
4. Look for correlation between email changes and retention improvements

**Example:** If you launched a new "Day 3 nudge" email and Day 7 return improved from 32% → 38%, that email is working.

**Action items:**
- Keep successful email campaigns running
- Test variations of winning emails (subject lines, timing, content)
- Pause or revise emails that don't improve retention

---

### 2. Identify Labs Task Impact on WFAU

**Goal:** See if syllabus gathering and QA work correlates with user growth

**Steps:**
1. Track WFAU trends over time
2. Note weeks with high syllabus delivery from Labs members
3. Look for correlation between syllabus coverage and WFAU at specific campuses

**Example:** If Labs gathered 20 UConn syllabi last week and UConn WFAU increased this week, that syllabus coverage may have helped.

**Action items:**
- Prioritize syllabus gathering at campuses with upcoming registration periods
- Focus Labs tasks on high-potential campuses (large schools with low WFAU)

---

### 3. Track Overall Platform Health

**Goal:** Ensure retention stays healthy as you scale WFAU

**Steps:**
1. Monitor both WFAU (volume) and Day 7 return (quality) each week
2. Watch for concerning patterns (e.g., WFAU growing but Day 7 return dropping)
3. Flag issues to Riley/Ethan if retention declines significantly

**Warning signs:**
- Day 7 return drops below 25%
- Large WFAU increase but Day 7 return stays flat or drops
- Specific sources have very low Day 7 return (<15%)

**Action items:**
- Investigate why retention is dropping (onboarding issues? Missing features?)
- Work with Riley/Ethan to improve product experience for low-retention sources

---

## Interpreting Trends

### Good Trends (Keep Doing What You're Doing)

✅ **WFAU increasing week-over-week** - Growth is working
✅ **Day 7 return stable or improving** - Users find value and stick around
✅ **Multiple sources contributing to WFAU** - Diversified growth (not reliant on one channel)
✅ **Campus coverage expanding** - More universities adopting DormWay

### Warning Signs (Investigate and Adjust)

⚠️ **WFAU flat or declining for 3+ weeks** - Growth stalled, need new tactics
⚠️ **Day 7 return dropping** - Users not finding value, product or onboarding issue
⚠️ **Single source dominating WFAU** - Risk if that channel dries up
⚠️ **Ambassador referrals declining** - Ambassadors may be losing motivation or running out of reach

### Action Items Based on Trends

| Trend | What It Means | What to Do |
|-------|---------------|------------|
| WFAU up, Day 7 return up | **Healthy growth** - scaling well | Keep current tactics, expand to new campuses |
| WFAU up, Day 7 return down | **Leaky bucket** - bringing in users but losing them | Lauren: Focus on lifecycle emails and onboarding improvements |
| WFAU flat, Day 7 return stable | **Growth plateau** - need new channels | Alex: Launch new outreach campaigns, recruit more ambassadors |
| WFAU down, Day 7 return down | **Crisis mode** - both acquisition and retention failing | Escalate to Riley/Ethan, review product and marketing strategy |

## Tips for Effective Analysis

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Compare Week-Over-Week" icon="chart-line">
    Don't just look at this week's numbers - compare to previous 4-6 weeks to spot trends. One bad week isn't a crisis, but 3-4 weeks of decline is a pattern.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Look at Source Quality, Not Just Volume" icon="star">
    A source with 20 WFAU and 50% Day 7 return is better than one with 100 WFAU and 15% Day 7 return. High retention = sustainable growth.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Account for Seasonality" icon="calendar">
    Expect WFAU to spike at semester start (Aug/Sept, Jan/Feb) and drop during breaks. Compare to the same week last year, not just last week.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Celebrate Wins" icon="party-horn">
    When you hit a WFAU record or see a big Day 7 return improvement, share it with the team! Recognize what worked so you can replicate it.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Numbers Look Wrong or Incomplete" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Issue:** Scoreboard shows 0 WFAU or very low numbers

    **Likely causes:**
    - Metrics haven't updated yet (they update overnight)
    - You're looking at the wrong week (check date range)
    - Data pipeline issue (rare)

    **Solution:**
    - Wait until Friday afternoon or Saturday morning for full week data
    - Double-check you're viewing the current week
    - If still wrong, message Riley/Ethan
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can't Filter by Specific Ambassador" icon="filter">
    **Issue:** Want to see one ambassador's performance, not all ambassador referrals

    **Current limitation:** Scoreboard shows source-level data (all ambassadors combined)

    **Workaround:**
    - Use Campus Outreach CRM to see individual ambassador performance
    - Track referrals manually in your own spreadsheet
    - Request this feature from Riley/Ethan if you need it regularly
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Day 7 Return Rate Seems Too High/Low" icon="question">
    **Issue:** Retention percentage doesn't match your intuition

    **Explanation:** Day 7 return is measured from first action date, not signup date. If a user signed up Monday but didn't upload their schedule until Friday, the 7-day window starts Friday.

    **This is normal:** Early users tend to have higher Day 7 return because they're more motivated (they bothered to complete onboarding). As WFAU grows, average Day 7 return may decrease slightly.

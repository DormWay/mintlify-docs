# Home V2 Widget System: Command Center Analysis

**Date:** 2025-12-08  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of existing widgets, missing widgets, and capabilities needed for the ultimate student command center  
**Based on:** Higher Ed Student Experience Research 2025 + Current DormWay Implementation

---

## Executive Summary

The Home V2 dashboard currently has **11 widget types** implementing a sophisticated elastic layout system. However, based on student pain points and research findings, there are **critical gaps** in proactive support, mental health integration, and non-traditional student features that could transform DormWay into a true "command center" for student life.

**Key Finding:** DormWay has excellent **reactive** widgets (showing what's due, what's next), but needs **proactive** widgets (early warnings, workload balancing, wellness nudges) to become a true crisis prevention system.

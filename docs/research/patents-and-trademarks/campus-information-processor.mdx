# Provisional Patent Draft: Campus Information Processor

## Title

_Multi-Level Context Processor for Campus Data Integration_

---

## Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to digital information systems. More specifically, it relates to methods and systems for integrating and cascading campus-level data into student context models, enabling personalized and real-time updates across academic, social, and safety domains.

---

## Background

Campus environments generate vast amounts of fragmented data: dining hall menus, transit schedules, safety alerts, building closures, events, and facility availability. Current tools fail to integrate this information in ways that are:

1. **Timely** – Students often only learn of disruptions (e.g., transit delays, room closures) after they occur.
    
2. **Personalized** – Information is distributed campus-wide rather than tailored to an individual’s schedule or location.
    
3. **Integrated** – Dining, safety, and academic updates are spread across separate systems.
    
4. **Scalable** – Universities operate unique systems; no general framework exists to normalize and cascade data to individual student experiences.
    

There is a need for a **campus information processor** that ingests diverse campus data sources, processes them through a hierarchical context model, and cascades relevant updates into personalized student contexts in real time.

---

## Summary of the Invention

The invention provides a **multi-level campus information processor** that:

- **Ingests campus-level data** including dining menus, safety alerts, transit feeds, facilities information, and events.
    
- **Normalizes inputs** into a common schema.
    
- **Cascades updates hierarchically** from campus → building → student contexts.
    
- **Generates personalized outputs**: recommendations, safety alerts, schedule adjustments, dining nudges.
    
- **Scales across institutions** by partitioning data per campus.
    

This invention is novel because it creates a **cascading, multi-tiered processing framework** that connects high-level campus events directly to personalized student actions.

## Detailed Description

### 1. Input Sources

- **Dining**: Menus, hours, occupancy rates.
    
- **Transit**: Shuttle schedules, delays, reroutes.
    
- **Safety**: Emergency alerts, weather warnings, facility lockdowns.
    
- **Facilities**: Room closures, maintenance schedules, occupancy feeds.
    
- **Events**: Club activities, campus-wide announcements, athletic events.
    

### 2. Processing Framework

- **Normalization Layer**: Converts raw feeds into structured schema.
    
- **Partitioning**: Each campus has its own context partition.
    
- **Cascade Logic**: Updates flow down hierarchy:
    
    - Campus-level → Building-level → Student-level.
        
    - Example: Dining menu update → building (dining hall) → student availability prompt.
        
- **Temporal Triggers**: Updates processed periodically or on threshold changes (e.g., occupancy < 20%, shuttle delay > 15 min).
    

### 3. Outputs

- **Personalized Alerts**: Dining suggestions, transit adjustments, safety instructions.
    
- **Planner Integration**: Automatically adjusts schedules to reflect changes.
    
- **Ambient Notifications**: Context-aware nudges delivered to student devices.
    

### 4. Embodiments

- **Campus-partitioned cloud service**: Each university has isolated partition for scalability.
    
- **Mobile-first integration**: Outputs consumed by student mobile app.
    
- **Smart display embodiment**: Outputs rendered on campus smart displays in location-aware mode.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Dining Hall Availability**
    
    - Dining hall reports capacity at 15%.
        
    - Student has a free lunch window.
        
    - Processor cascades update and notifies student: “Your favorite hall has space now.”
        
2. **Transit Delay**
    
    - Shuttle reports 20-minute delay.
        
    - Student context shows class at remote campus in 40 minutes.
        
    - Processor cascades update, notifies student to depart earlier or take alternative route.
        
3. **Safety Alert**
    
    - Campus police issue shelter-in-place warning.
        
    - Processor identifies student’s current building.
        
    - Cascades update to student: personalized instructions for that building.
        
4. **Event Reminder**
    
    - Club meeting added to campus calendar.
        
    - Processor detects student is a member.
        
    - Cascades update to student planner with time and location.

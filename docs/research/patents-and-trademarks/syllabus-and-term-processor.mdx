# Provisional Patent Draft: Adaptive Day Planner

## Title

_Adaptive Student Day Planner Using Prior Behavior to Dynamically Adjust Current Schedules_

---

## Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to intelligent scheduling systems and digital productivity tools. More specifically, it relates to methods and systems for dynamically adjusting a student’s daily plan based on prior-day activities, contextual inputs, and academic obligations, thereby enabling optimized time management and improved academic and wellness outcomes.

---

## Background

Students manage highly variable schedules combining classes, extracurriculars, meals, exercise, social events, and study blocks. Existing digital planners and calendars are inadequate because:

1. **Static Schedules** – Traditional planners rely on fixed entries and reminders without considering how a student’s behavior changes day to day.
    
2. **No Behavioral Adaptation** – Students’ productivity, focus, and engagement patterns vary, but current systems don’t adapt to learned preferences.
    
3. **Fragmented Data Sources** – Information on class times, assignments, and extracurriculars exists in silos across different apps.
    
4. **Wellness Blindness** – Most scheduling systems don’t account for wellness (sleep, meals, movement) when generating schedules.
    

There is a need for a system that not only integrates academic and lifestyle obligations but **learns from past days** to dynamically optimize today’s plan.

---

## Summary of the Invention

The invention provides an **Adaptive Day Planner** that:

- **Ingests prior-day behavior**: attendance, movement patterns, meal times, study sessions, sleep cycles.
    
- **Learns daily rhythms**: identifies productivity windows, fatigue patterns, and dining/exercise gaps.
    
- **Adjusts today’s plan dynamically**: schedules study, dining, and rest around obligations and predicted needs.
    
- **Generates proactive notifications**: nudges students with optimized timing and messaging for tasks.
    

This system is novel in its integration of **historical behavior** with **academic and campus context** to dynamically adjust each day’s plan.

## Detailed Description

### 1. Inputs

- **Academic data**: Calendar sync, syllabus-derived deadlines, Canvas updates.
    
- **Behavioral data**: Device motion, class attendance logs, dining times.
    
- **Wellness data (optional)**: Sleep cycles, step counts, exercise records.
    

### 2. Adaptive Planning Engine

- **Pattern recognition**: Detects recurring productive hours (e.g., 9–11 AM focus window).
    
- **Behavioral adjustments**: If meals were skipped yesterday, adds meal reminders today.
    
- **Fatigue-aware planning**: If prior day included heavy walking or late study, adjusts current day’s plan for lighter load.
    
- **Balancing algorithm**: Distributes academic and social obligations while inserting recovery breaks.
    

### 3. Outputs

- **Adaptive Schedule**: Updated calendar view with time blocks adjusted dynamically.
    
- **Context-Aware Notifications**: Push alerts that guide the student (e.g., “Best time to start your problem set is now”).
    
- **Nudges for balance**: Prompts for wellness (“Take a break; you’ve been studying for 90 minutes”).
    

### 4. Embodiments

- **Mobile-first**: Planner integrated within a mobile app.
    
- **Cross-platform**: Schedule sync with Google Calendar, iCal, Notion, etc.
    
- **Wellness-augmented**: Integrates wearables for richer data (e.g., step count, heart rate).

## Example Scenarios

1. **Productivity Window Reuse**
    
    - Student completed assignments effectively from 9–11 AM yesterday.
        
    - Planner blocks the same time for a high-priority problem set today.
        
2. **Meal Reminder Insertion**
    
    - Student skipped lunch yesterday.
        
    - Planner adds explicit lunch reminder in today’s free window.
        
3. **Fatigue Adjustment**
    
    - Student walked 12,000 steps yesterday due to scattered classes.
        
    - Planner reduces walking time today by recommending nearby study spots.
        
4. **Wellness Balancing**
    
    - Student studied until 2 AM yesterday.
        
    - Planner delays morning reminders and emphasizes lighter study load early in the day.

## Potential Claims

1. A method for dynamically adjusting a student’s daily schedule based on prior-day activity and behavioral data.
    
2. A system that identifies productivity windows and adapts current-day task placement accordingly.
    
3. Integration of wellness and behavioral heuristics into academic scheduling.
    
4. Automatic insertion of wellness reminders (meals, breaks, exercise) into daily plans.
    
5. Embodiments including mobile-only, cross-platform calendar integration, and wearable-augmented inputs.

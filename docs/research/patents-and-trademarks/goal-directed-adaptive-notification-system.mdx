# Provisional Patent Draft: Goal-Directed Adaptive Notification System

## Title

_System and Method for Goal-Driven Generation of Push and Email Notifications Using Large Language Models Mirroring User Behavior_

---

## Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to intelligent communication systems, and more specifically to methods and systems for dynamically generating personalized notifications using large language models (LLMs) guided by engagement goals, contextual signals, and heuristics derived from user behavior.

---

## Background

Traditional notification systems suffer from limitations:

1. **Static Content** – Prewritten templates or generic reminders that don’t adapt to the user.
    
2. **Timing Guesswork** – Fixed schedules that ignore individual user habits and daily rhythms.
    
3. **No Goal Optimization** – Messages are not tuned toward business or engagement goals (open, click, conversion).
    
4. **One-Size Fits All** – No modeling of how _this user_ responds to specific tones, formats, or channels.
    

Current personalization is usually limited to simple data substitution (e.g., first name, due date) rather than true _dynamic generation based on engagement optimization_.

---

## Summary of the Invention

The invention provides a **goal-directed adaptive notification system** that:

- Uses **fine-tuned LLMs** to dynamically generate notification copy (push, email, SMS, in-app banners) at delivery time.
    
- Aligns generation with **explicit engagement goals** (open, click, purchase, attendance, retention).
    
- **Mirrors individual user behavior** by training on heuristics derived from prior engagement patterns (response times, tone preference, channel receptivity).
    
- Continuously adapts via a closed-loop feedback system, optimizing for long-term engagement while minimizing notification fatigue.
    
- Integrates **contextual data** from broader systems (e.g., DormWay’s Context Engine) to further improve timing and relevance.
    

This invention is novel in its use of **goal-driven, behavior-mirroring LLMs** that generate notifications on the fly, optimized both for timing and content, rather than relying on static templates.

## Brief Description of the Drawings

**FIG. 1** – System Architecture: User behavior log → heuristic extraction → goal-set LLM → channel optimizer → notification delivery → feedback loop.  
**FIG. 2** – Process Flow: engagement goal input → heuristic conditioning → on-the-fly LLM generation → delivery via optimal channel/time → user response → retraining.  
**FIG. 3** – Multi-Model Variant: separate LLMs per channel (push, email, SMS) coordinated through a goal orchestration layer.

## Detailed Description

### 1. Inputs

- **Engagement Goals**: defined by system or business (e.g., maximize open rates, drive purchase, increase event RSVP, reduce churn).
    
- **User Behavior Heuristics**: response history, dwell times, device usage, prior notification outcomes, sentiment preferences, tone receptivity.
    
- **Contextual Data**: time of day, location, current activity or schedule (from context engine).
    
- **Channel Metadata**: availability and constraints of push, email, SMS, in-app messaging.
    

### 2. Processing

- **Heuristic Extraction Module**: converts engagement logs into features (e.g., “responds to emojis,” “prefers formal language,” “high open probability at 8–10 AM”).
    
- **Goal-Set LLM**: a fine-tuned model conditioned on both engagement goals and heuristics. Capable of generating multiple candidate messages optimized for different tradeoffs (click-through vs. long-term retention).
    
- **Dynamic Copy Generation**: produces notification text in real time, customized by user patterns, engagement goal, and context.
    
- **Channel & Timing Optimization**: predicts which channel and what time maximizes probability of achieving the goal. May delay delivery until a receptive moment is forecast.
    
- **Variant Generation**: creates multiple versions (A/B/C) of a notification to test and refine engagement performance in real time.
    

### 3. Output

- **Adaptive Notifications**: real-time generated, context-aware, and user-specific.
    
- **Channel Assignment**: automatically selects channel(s) and delivery window.
    
- **Goal Alignment Report**: internal metrics showing confidence and expected impact relative to the engagement goal.
    
- **Feedback Loop**: engagement outcomes update the heuristic model and retrain LLM weights or prompt strategies, creating a continuous learning cycle.
    

### 4. Embodiments

- **Mobile-only embodiment**: limited to push notifications optimized by LLMs.
    
- **Cross-channel embodiment**: includes email, SMS, and in-app banners.
    
- **Multi-LLM embodiment**: separate specialized LLMs for push vs. email vs. SMS coordinated by a central goal orchestrator.
    
- **Privacy-preserving embodiment**: all behavioral heuristics processed locally or stored in campus-partitioned databases, with only anonymized metrics used for global optimization.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Course Reminder Push**
    
    - Goal: maximize assignment submission on time.
        
    - Heuristics: Student usually responds to concise, emoji-rich notifications at 9 AM.
        
    - Generated: “Quick reminder 🚀 – Chem lab is due tonight. Knock it out before lunch?”
        
2. **Event Attendance Email**
    
    - Goal: increase RSVP to campus club event.
        
    - Heuristics: User engages more with detailed, bullet-point emails opened in the evening.
        
    - Generated: “Join us this Thursday at 7 PM for the Robotics Club mixer! • Snacks provided • Meet recruiters • RSVP here.”
        
3. **Fitness Nudge SMS**
    
    - Goal: re-engage after 7 days of inactivity.
        
    - Heuristics: Responds best to motivational tone via SMS around 5 PM.
        
    - Generated: “You crushed it last week 💪 – ready to get moving again? Quick 30-min session tonight?”
        
4. **Long-Term Retention**
    
    - Goal: reduce churn probability.
        
    - Heuristics: User ignores frequent pushes but responds positively to weekly summary emails.
        
    - Generated: “Here’s your weekly progress snapshot 📊 – 3 assignments done, 2 upcoming. You’re on track!”

## Potential Claims

1. A method for dynamically generating notifications using an LLM conditioned on user heuristics, engagement goals, and contextual signals.
    
2. A system that mirrors individual user behavior through heuristic modeling and generates adaptive copy to maximize open, click, or conversion rates.
    
3. A feedback loop where engagement outcomes continuously update heuristic features and retrain the generative LLM.
    
4. A multi-channel optimization system that selects notification channel and timing dynamically based on predicted receptivity.
    
5. An architecture comprising multiple specialized LLMs coordinated by a goal orchestration layer to generate goal-aligned notifications.
    
6. A privacy-preserving embodiment where heuristic data is processed within a secure, partitioned ecosystem and only aggregated performance data leaves the partition.

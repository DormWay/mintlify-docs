## **Title**

  

_Campus Connect: Context-Aware Business Integration and Adaptive Communication System for Students_

---

## **Field of the Invention**

  

The present invention relates generally to digital communication systems, and more specifically to methods and systems for connecting businesses with student users through context-aware engagement. The invention combines real-time campus context modeling with adaptive communication optimization to maximize the effectiveness of business-to-student interactions.

---

## **Background**

  

College students are a highly desirable but difficult-to-reach demographic. Traditional advertising and marketing systems suffer from several shortcomings:

1. **Irrelevance of Timing** – Ads and offers are delivered without regard to where the student is, what they are doing, or when they are most receptive.
    
2. **Generic Messaging** – Communications are static email blasts or generic push notifications that fail to reflect individual habits and preferences.
    
3. **Low Engagement** – Students, overwhelmed with digital noise, ignore most offers. Engagement rates remain low despite significant advertiser spend.
    
4. **Lack of Campus Integration** – Existing systems are not aware of campus-specific schedules, transit systems, or academic cycles, leaving them blind to the daily rhythms that govern student decision-making.
    
5. **Privacy Risks** – Conventional ad networks often rely on sharing personally identifiable information (PII) with third parties, which can violate student trust and regulatory requirements.
    

  

There exists a need for a system that connects businesses with students at the **right moment**, using **personalized communication** that adapts dynamically, while preserving privacy and respecting the unique context of campus life.

## **Summary of the Invention**

  

Campus Connect is a **business integration platform** layered on top of DormWay’s **student context engine**. The invention provides:

- **Context-based timing**: Determines the optimal moment to deliver a business message based on student context (location, class schedule, transit status, dining habits, exam calendar).
    
- **Adaptive communication optimization**: Dynamically rewrites and adjusts message content, branding, and channel (push, email, in-app banner) to maximize open rates, click-through rates, or conversions.
    
- **Goal-driven delivery**: Businesses specify objectives (e.g., coupon redemption, website click, event attendance), and the system adjusts communication strategies accordingly.
    
- **Privacy-preserving architecture**: Businesses never access raw student data; the DormWay engine mediates the communication and targets based on context models.
    

  

This invention differs from traditional ad systems in that it integrates **academic and campus lifecycle awareness** into monetization, and adapts not only timing but also **language, tone, and content** in real time for each student.

## **Detailed Description**

  

### **1. Architecture**

1. **Student Context Engine**
    
    Continuously generates real-time context for each student based on:
    
    - Location (GPS, campus map).
        
    - Academic schedule (Canvas sync, syllabus extraction).
        
    - Campus events and services (dining, transit, clubs, safety).
        
    - Personal behavior heuristics (study times, dining patterns, notification response history).
        
    
2. **Business Integration Layer (Campus Connect)**
    
    - Businesses register campaigns with goals (e.g., “increase foot traffic 8–11 AM,” “boost tutoring sign-ups before midterms”).
        
    - Campaigns define targeting parameters: category (food, fitness, study aid), timing constraints, preferred channels.
        
    - The system identifies students whose **real-time context** aligns with campaign goals.
        
    
3. **Adaptive Communication Module**
    
    - Rewrites content dynamically: adjusts tone, length, and CTA based on student engagement history.
        
    - Example: Student A responds better to humor → message is lighthearted; Student B prefers brevity → message is concise.
        
    - Channel optimization: Push vs. email vs. in-app banner determined by past engagement.
        
    
4. **Privacy Broker**
    
    - Student data never leaves DormWay.
        
    - Businesses interact with anonymized campaign dashboards (e.g., “200 impressions delivered, 60 clicks”).
        
    - All matching and message adaptation occurs within the trusted student ecosystem.
        
    

  

### **2. Operation Flow**

1. Campaign goal submitted by business.
    
2. Context engine identifies matching student states.
    
3. Communication optimizer generates candidate messages.
    
4. Privacy broker approves and dispatches messages.
    
5. Feedback loop updates student’s habit profile.
    

  

### **3. Variants / Embodiments**

- **Mobile-only embodiment**: Push notifications and in-app banners.
    
- **Multi-channel embodiment**: Adds email, SMS (opt-in), and smart campus displays.
    
- **Context granularity variations**: Building-level precision (e.g., library study floors) vs. campus-level targeting.

## **Example Scenarios**

1. **Coffee Shop Offer**
    
    - Student has a 10 AM lecture. At 9:25, context engine detects they are leaving dorm.
        
    - Campus Connect delivers a coupon for a nearby café timed as they walk past.
        
    - Message tone uses humor for Student A (“Fuel up before Chem 101”) and straightforward CTA for Student B (“20% off coffee until 10 AM”).
        
    
2. **Tutoring Service**
    
    - Finals week detected. Student habit profile shows high stress and late-night app usage.
        
    - Push notification rewritten empathetically: “Need a boost for finals? Tutors available tonight.”
        
    
3. **Fitness Center Promotion**
    
    - Student has skipped gym for 7 days.
        
    - Email dynamically rewritten with motivational copy (“Get back on track — first class free this week”).
        
    - Delivered at time student usually opens email (lunchtime).
        
    
4. **Campus Bookstore**
    
    - Syllabus processor notes upcoming exam in physics.
        
    - Bookstore campaign for calculators delivered two days before exam, with message rewritten to match urgency.

## **Potential Claims**

1. A method for connecting businesses with student users via a context-aware engine that determines optimal timing for communication delivery based on academic and campus life signals.
    
2. A system for dynamically rewriting communication content (tone, branding, CTA) per student engagement patterns to maximize specified business objectives.
    
3. A privacy-preserving architecture wherein businesses do not access raw student data, and communication targeting is mediated by an internal engine.
    
4. A feedback loop where student interaction data refines future communication strategies.
    
5. Embodiments covering mobile push, email, in-app banners, and smart displays.

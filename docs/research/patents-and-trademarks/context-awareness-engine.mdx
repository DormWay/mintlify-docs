## Provisional Patent Draft: Context Awareness Engine

_System and Method for Continuous Generation of Student Context in a Campus Environment_

---

## Field of the Invention

The present invention relates to artificial intelligence and digital scheduling systems. More specifically, it relates to methods and systems for generating and maintaining a continuously updated “context state” of a student’s academic and campus life, enabling adaptive planning, recommendations, and proactive notifications.

---

## Background

Students face complex and fragmented daily routines. They navigate between classes, extracurricular activities, dining, campus facilities, transit, and social events. Existing solutions—such as calendar sync tools, navigation apps, or generic productivity software—are insufficient because:

1. **Static Data** – Calendars or maps present static schedules and routes, but do not adapt in real time to changes in the student’s environment.
    
2. **Siloed Services** – Dining menus, safety alerts, club meetings, and class assignments are spread across disconnected platforms.
    
3. **No Predictive Layer** – Current tools lack the ability to forecast what a student is likely to do next based on past movement and habits.
    
4. **No Cascading Model** – Systems cannot integrate multiple levels of context (city, campus, building, student) into a coherent real-time view.
    

There is a need for a **context-awareness engine** that continuously generates a real-time, predictive model of a student’s life on campus.

---

## Summary of the Invention

The invention provides a **context-awareness system** that:

- **Aggregates inputs** from multiple sources including GPS, device motion, course schedules, campus events, dining menus, transit feeds, and external data (e.g., weather).
    
- **Processes these inputs hierarchically** through a cascading model (city → campus → building → student).
    
- **Maintains a continuously updated context state** describing the student’s likely current activity, location, and near-future needs.
    
- **Outputs contextual signals** consumed by downstream systems such as adaptive planners, notification schedulers, and business integration platforms (e.g., Campus Connect).
    

This invention is novel because it creates a **multi-level, predictive, real-time context model** tailored specifically to the academic and campus environment.

## Brief Description of the Drawings

!ContextEngine_Fig1_Hierarchy.png

**FIG. 1** – Context hierarchy architecture:

- Inputs from city-level (weather, transit), campus-level (events, dining, safety), building-level (room closures, capacity), and student-level (schedule, motion).
    
- Outputs a real-time student context state.

## Detailed Description

### 1. Input Sources

- **City-level**: Weather, local events, transportation systems.
    
- **Campus-level**: Dining hall menus, campus safety alerts, event calendars, clubs.
    
- **Building-level**: Classroom schedules, closures, occupancy rates.
    
- **Student-level**: Academic schedules, syllabus data, GPS, device motion, engagement history.
    

### 2. Context Processing

- **Cascading Hierarchy**: Context generated at each level propagates downward. Example: city-level weather update cascades through campus transit schedules down to student reminders.
    
- **Heuristic & Predictive Modeling**: Uses past movement patterns and behaviors (e.g., typical dining times, class attendance history) to forecast the student’s next action.
    
- **Temporal Framework**: Context updated in rolling intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes) or upon detected threshold shifts (e.g., Δtemperature > 5°, transit delay > 10 minutes).
    

### 3. Output

- **Context State Object**: JSON-encoded model describing current and predicted activity. Example fields:
    
    - `current_location`
        
    - `next_expected_location`
        
    - `active_course`
        
    - `available_time_block`
        
    - `predicted_need` (e.g., study, dining, transit)
        
- **Signals**: Published to downstream modules, e.g.:
    
    - Planner adjusts daily schedule.
        
    - Notification engine generates timely nudges.
        
    - Campus Connect identifies optimal ad opportunities.
        

### 4. Embodiments

- **Mobile-only embodiment**: Runs on a mobile app, using device sensors.
    
- **Distributed embodiment**: Context engine runs on a cloud service with student devices as endpoints.
    
- **Privacy-preserving embodiment**: Context states remain in-device and only derived signals are shared with external systems.

## Example Scenarios

1. **Morning Class with Weather Delay**
    
    - Student context engine predicts student will leave dorm at 8:45 for 9:00 class.
        
    - City-level weather reports rain.
        
    - Campus-level transit feed shows delays.
        
    - Engine updates context: student must depart 10 minutes earlier. Notification triggered.
        
2. **Lunch Gap Opportunity**
    
    - Engine detects free time from 12:00–1:30.
        
    - Dining hall occupancy feed shows 15% capacity.
        
    - Context output: “Optimal dining window” signal. Planner adjusts schedule and triggers meal reminder.
        
3. **Library Study Spot Recommendation**
    
    - Engine predicts student will study between 3–5 PM.
        
    - Building-level occupancy indicates quiet floor at 20% capacity.
        
    - Student receives prompt: “Your usual study floor is open.”
        
4. **Emergency Cascade**
    
    - Campus-level safety alert issued.
        
    - Engine identifies student’s building context.
        
    - Output: personalized evacuation route.

## Potential Claims

1. A method for generating continuous context states for students by aggregating city, campus, building, and student-level data.
    
2. A hierarchical context processing model that cascades updates from higher levels (city) to lower levels (student).
    
3. A predictive modeling framework that forecasts next student activities based on prior movement and behavior.
    
4. A system that outputs context signals consumable by downstream scheduling, notification, or monetization systems.
    
5. Embodiments including mobile-only, cloud-distributed, and privacy-preserving implementations.

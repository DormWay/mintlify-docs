3. **Protective Filings:** Ace, BrainGains, Ambient Intelligence (to secure IP around branded technology names).

## Notes

- Priority should be given to DormWay, Campus Connect, and Way Works to secure brand foundation and future expansion potential.
    
- LifeWay should be treated as high-risk due to descriptiveness and prior registrations.
    
- Consider global filing in key markets (US, EU, UK, Canada, Australia) as product expands.

title: "Investor Pitch Refinement   Key Takeaways from Andrew Berg Meeting"
description: "Andrew raised a fundamental question: **\"Do students actually prioritize what you're building?\"**"
---

**Date:** November 20, 2025  
**Meeting:** Ethan Kaplan + Andrew Berg (OpenView)  
**Purpose:** Identify improvements for future investor conversations

---

## Critical Investor Concern

Andrew raised a fundamental question: **"Do students actually prioritize what you're building?"**

This is the single most important signal from the meeting. Andrew wasn't convinced students care about the problem you're solving. Everything else in the pitch is secondary to addressing this concern.

---

## Proposed Pitch Structure Change: Riley Leads

### Current Structure (What Happened with Andrew)

- Ethan presents product vision and features
- Riley's role as co-founder mentioned but not central
- Investor questions whether adults understand student priorities
- Response relies on "research and student feedback" (abstract)

### Recommended Structure

**Riley leads first 15 minutes:**

- Personal story: Why you built this
- Product demo: What you built
- Early validation: Students using it

**Ethan closes last 10 minutes:**

- Execution plan: How we scale
- Technical capability: Infrastructure
- Funding strategy: What we're raising and why

### Why This Matters

**Founder-market fit solves Andrew's concern directly:**

When Ethan (30 years in tech, Universal Audio CDO) presents a student product, investors question: "Does he understand what students actually need?"

When Riley (Michigan senior, current user, built it for himself) presents, that question disappears. You're not hypothesizing about student priorities - you lived the problem and built the solution.

**Historical precedent:**

- Zuckerberg pitched Facebook at 19
- Evan Spiegel pitched Snapchat at 21
- Their youth proved market understanding, not undermined it

**Handling investor skepticism:**

_Ethan presenting:_

- Andrew: "Do students care about this?"
- Ethan: "Based on feedback from students..."
- Andrew: (skeptical of secondhand data)

_Riley presenting:_

- Andrew: "Do students care about this?"
- Riley: "I missed three assignments last semester because they were buried in Canvas. My roommate failed a midterm because the date changed and he never saw it. I built this because I was drowning. I use it every day. So do 80 students at Michigan."
- Andrew: (either convinced or asks different questions)

## What Riley Should Own in the Pitch

### 1. The Problem (Your Story)

**Duration:** 3 minutes

**Structure:**

- Specific incident: "February 2024, I missed a project deadline worth 20% of my grade. The assignment was posted in Canvas three weeks earlier but I never saw it."
- The root cause: "Canvas, email, syllabus PDFs, Google Calendar - all disconnected. No unified view."
- The breaking point: "I was streaming to 100K followers and couldn't manage my own coursework. Something had to change."

**Why this works:** Investors bet on founders who experienced the problem personally. Your ADHD and streaming career aren't liabilities - they're proof you understand the customer viscerally.

### 2. The Product Demo (What You Built)

**Duration:** 7 minutes

**Structure:**

- Onboarding flow: "Email syllabus to syllabus@dormway.app. OCR processes it. Done."
- Core view: "Do Now. Up Next. Due Soon. Everything from Canvas + syllabi + calendar."
- Key differentiator: "Ace knows YOUR courses. Not generic ChatGPT."
- Campus intelligence: "Buildings, schedules, study windows - contextual awareness."

**What to show:**

- Your actual DormWay account with your classes
- Real assignments from your current semester
- Live demo of asking Ace a question about YOUR coursework

**Why this works:** You're not selling a concept. You're showing what you use every single day.

### 3. Early Validation (Students Using It)

**Duration:** 5 minutes

**Structure:**

- Current usage: "80 Michigan students in private beta"
- Retention metric: "72% weekly retention after 6 weeks"
- NPS score: "4.8/5.0 - students say they'd be devastated if it disappeared"
- Specific testimonials: "Quote from actual student with name/major"
- Expansion plan: "Product development cohort starting - 20 students across 10 universities"

**Why this works:** These aren't test users - they're peers you recruited because they had the same problem you did.

---

## What Ethan Should Own in the Pitch

### 1. Execution Plan (How We Scale)

**Duration:** 4 minutes

**Structure:**

- Phase 1: Prove Michigan (80 → 2,000 students by March)
- Phase 2: Multi-campus (10 universities by June)
- Phase 3: National (100 campuses by December)
- Distribution: Riley's 100K followers + campus ambassadors + viral mechanics
- Timeline: January launch, Series A by end of 2026

**Why this works:** Ethan's 30 years of experience answers "Can they execute?" Riley answers "Do students want this?"

### 2. Technical Capability (Infrastructure)

**Duration:** 3 minutes

**Structure:**

- Architecture: SwiftUI, TypeScript, Temporal
- AI integration: Agentic workflows, LLM context intelligence
- Scalability: Works at 6,200+ institutions, no IT approval required
- Data strategy: FERPA compliant, on-device processing

**Why this works:** Ethan's credibility here is unquestionable. This is where his background matters most.

### 3. Funding Strategy (What We're Raising)

**Duration:** 3 minutes

**Structure:**

- Current: Pre-seed safe completed
- Target: $1.5M seed round
- Use of funds: 2 engineers, campus expansion, Riley full-time post-graduation
- Milestones: 10,000 students, $1.5M ARR (Campus Connect), Series A ready

**Why this works:** Ethan knows how to talk to investors about capital deployment. Riley doesn't need to.

## Product Development Priorities Based on Investor Feedback

### 1. Canvas Write Access (Critical)

**Current state:** Read-only integration  
**Investor concern:** Students won't leave Canvas if they can't mark assignments complete

**Action:** Prioritize official Instructure API partnership or OAuth write permissions. Without this, students have two systems to manage.

### 2. Feature Set Simplification (Critical)

**Current state:** Demo covered calendar, notes, flashcards, study groups, desktop app, mobile app, weather, campus navigation  
**Investor concern:** Too many features dilutes value proposition

**Action:** Strip demo to three features:

1. Schedule auto-sync (Canvas + OCR)
2. Syllabus parsing (email → organized view)
3. Unified timeline (Do Now / Up Next / Due Soon)

Show depth of these three, not breadth of ten.

### 3. Usage Data Collection (Critical)

**Current state:** No retention/engagement metrics mentioned in pitch  
**Investor concern:** No proof students use it daily

**Action:** Track and report:

- Daily active users
- Weekly retention rate
- Session frequency
- Feature usage breakdown
- NPS score

Andrew needs to see students opening DormWay daily, not a feature roadmap.

### 4. Mode Detection System (Medium Priority)

**Current state:** Customizable structure based on user preferences  
**Investor concern:** Sounds complicated, might create decision fatigue

**Action:** Evaluate whether "mode detection" is necessary. Students want it to just work. Consider removing customization in favor of smart defaults.

### 5. Partnership Strategy Clarity (Medium Priority)

**Current state:** Mentioned Live Nation, Starbucks, financial services without context  
**Investor concern:** Distraction from core academic problem

**Action:** Move partnership discussion to later in pitch (Ethan's section on monetization). Don't lead with it. Investors need to see students using core features before revenue strategies.

## Addressing the Core Concern: "Do Students Care?"

### Current Evidence

- 80 Michigan students in private beta
- 4.8/5.0 NPS score
- 72% weekly retention
- Student testimonials

### Missing Evidence (Collect Before Next Pitch)

- Daily active usage rate
- Session frequency (how often students open DormWay per day)
- Feature retention (which features drive return visits)
- Organic growth rate (word-of-mouth signups)
- Comparison to alternatives (what students used before, why they switched)

### Riley's Unique Advantage

You can say: "I'm a student. I use this every day. I recruited these 80 students from my classes and dorm. They weren't paid. They use it because it solves a problem they all have."

That's not market research. That's proof.

## Risk Mitigation: Riley Leading

**Concern:** Riley doesn't have business experience, might struggle with tough investor questions.

**Counter:** At seed stage, investors bet on founder-market fit over business experience. Riley doesn't need to know SaaS metrics inside-out. Riley needs to prove students want this. Ethan's presence solves the execution concern.

**Division of labor:**

- Riley = Market validation ("Students want this")
- Ethan = Execution capability ("We can scale this")

**If Riley gets a question outside his domain:**

- "That's a great question. Ethan, can you speak to that?"
- Natural handoff, shows team cohesion

---

## Next Steps

### For Riley

1. Draft 3-minute version of personal story (why you built DormWay)
2. Practice live demo using your actual account
3. Collect specific student testimonials (names, quotes, context)
4. Prepare to answer: "Why will students use this daily?"

### For Ethan

1. Prepare 10-minute execution/technical/funding section
2. Create backup slides for deep technical questions
3. Build financial model showing path to Series A
4. Prepare handoff phrases when Riley gets investor questions outside his domain

### Together

1. Run through full 25-minute pitch
2. Practice handoffs between Riley and Ethan sections
3. Prepare for common investor objections
4. Identify 3 metrics to track weekly (DAU, retention, NPS)

---

## Conclusion

Andrew's concern about student priorities is solvable. Riley leading the pitch transforms "tech exec building EdTech" into "student who built solution for himself + experienced exec to scale it."

The product development priorities are clear: prove students use core features daily before adding more features. Canvas write access is critical. Simplify the demo.

The pitch structure change isn't about Riley's presentation skills. It's about authenticity. Investors need to see founder-market fit. Riley provides that in ways Ethan cannot, regardless of experience level.

Let's discuss which changes to implement for the next investor meeting.

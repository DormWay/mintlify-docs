# Analysis & Research

## Purpose
This section contains gap analyses, technical investigations, feature feasibility studies, and research documentation for DormWay platform.

## Structure
Analysis documents are organized by topic area and investigation type, including material gaps, widget implementations, and feature analyses.

## Key Analyses

### Material & Content Gaps
- [Material Gaps Analysis - Sep 2025](/docs/research/analysis/material-gaps-analysis-sep-2025) - Analysis of missing materials and content
- [AI Processing Gaps Analysis](/docs/plans/workplan/ai-processing-gaps-analysis) - Gaps in AI processing pipeline (also in Workplan)

### Feature Analysis
- [Term View analysis](/docs/research/analysis/term-view-analysis) - Term view feature analysis
- [WIDGET_ENVELOPE_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS](/docs/research/analysis/widgetenvelopeimplementationstatus) - Widget envelope implementation status

### Sub-Categories
- [Amplitude Analytics](/docs/research/analysis/amplitude/readme) - Analytics and usage analysis

## Analysis Types

### 📊 Gap Analysis
Identifying missing functionality, content, or capabilities in current system.

### 🔬 Technical Investigation
Deep dives into technical feasibility, performance, or architecture questions.

### 📈 Usage Analysis
User behavior analysis, feature adoption, and metrics evaluation.

### 🎯 Feature Feasibility
Evaluating viability and approach for new features.

## Analysis Template

When creating new analyses, include:
1. **Context**: What prompted this analysis
2. **Current State**: What exists today
3. **Gaps/Issues**: What's missing or broken
4. **Recommendations**: Proposed solutions or approaches
5. **Next Steps**: Action items and ownership
6. **References**: Related docs and data sources

- [Beta Docs](/docs/product/beta/readme) - Beta requirements
- [Session Notes](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) - Context from decision-making sessions

## Usage Notes
- **Before Implementation**: Run gap analysis to understand scope
- **During Planning**: Reference analyses for context and requirements
- **After Launch**: Conduct retrospective analysis

## Maintenance

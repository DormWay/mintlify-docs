Looking at your Academic Term analysis view and the DormWay vision, here's a redesigned taxonomy with better progressive disclosure:

## Proposed Information Architecture

### **Level 1: Dashboard Summary** (Default View)

```
Academic Pulse
├── Current Week Snapshot
│   ├── Today's Schedule (classes + tasks due)
│   ├── Upcoming 48hrs (critical items only)
│   └── Weekly Load Indicator (visual stress meter)
├── Course Performance Cards (collapsed)
│   └── [Expand to show grade trends, upcoming work]
└── Quick Actions Bar
    ├── Add Task
    ├── View Calendar
    └── Find Building
```

### **Level 2: Course Deep Dive** (On Selection)

```
[Course Name] Command Center
├── Timeline View
│   ├── Past (completed work, grades received)
│   ├── Present (active assignments, current week)
│   └── Future (upcoming exams, projects)
├── Performance Analytics
│   ├── Grade Trajectory (with projection)
│   ├── Time Investment vs Output
│   └── Comparison to Class Average (if available)
└── Resources Hub
    ├── Syllabus Quick Ref
    ├── Office Hours
    ├── Study Group Finder
    └── Related Campus Resources
```

### **Level 3: Workload Intelligence** (Advanced View)

```
Semester Strategy
├── Heat Map Calendar
│   ├── Crunch Periods (multiple deadlines)
│   ├── Breathing Room (lighter weeks)
│   └── Optimal Study Windows
├── Task Dependencies
│   ├── Project Chains (related assignments)
│   ├── Prerequisite Tracking
│   └── Bottleneck Warnings
└── Smart Recommendations
    ├── "Start this early" alerts
    ├── Time blocking suggestions
    └── Break/recovery scheduling
```

## Progressive Disclosure Strategy

### **Entry Point** (What users see first)

- **3-Line Summary**: "You have 2 tasks today, 5 this week. Next crunch: Oct 3-5"
- **Visual Load Indicator**: Simple 5-bar meter showing current stress level
- **One-Tap Expansions**: Each section starts collapsed with preview data

### **Interaction Patterns**

1. **Swipe Down**: Reveals more time periods (today → week → month)
2. **Tap & Hold**: Shows context menu (mark complete, reschedule, get help)
3. **Pinch to Zoom**: Timeline compression/expansion
4. **Shake to Simplify**: Returns to most basic view when overwhelmed

### **Smart Filters** (Contextual)

```
Show me only:
□ Due in next 24 hours
□ Worth >10% of grade
□ Requiring group coordination
□ Not yet started
□ At risk items (trending late)
```

## Data Hierarchy Redesign

### **Primary Metrics** (Always Visible)

1. Time until next deadline
2. Today's commitment hours
3. Current week stress level

### **Secondary Metrics** (One Tap Away)

1. Grade projections by course
2. Study time recommendations
3. Campus resource suggestions

### **Tertiary Metrics** (Settings/Advanced)

1. Historical performance patterns
2. Peer comparison data
3. Detailed analytics exports

## Visual Treatment Concepts

### **Density Modes**

- **Zen Mode**: Minimal, just next action
- **Standard Mode**: Your current view level
- **Power Mode**: Everything visible, small fonts, max density

### **Temporal Grouping**

Instead of showing all assignments equally:

- **NOW** (0-24hrs): Full detail, red/orange
- **SOON** (2-7 days): Medium detail, yellow
- **LATER** (8-30 days): Compressed, blue/gray
- **SOMEDAY** (31+ days): Hidden unless requested

### **Smart Bundling**

Group related items:

- "3 Canvas submissions due together"
- "Midterm week cluster (4 exams)"
- "Project sequence (proposal → draft → final)"

This approach reduces cognitive load while maintaining full functionality for power users who want to dive deep.

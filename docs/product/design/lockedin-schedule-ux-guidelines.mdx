# LockedIn Schedule UX Guidelines (Current)

## Purpose
Define the web schedule page (semester view + schedule tab) visual and interaction rules so it feels like a helpful upperclassman: fast to scan, minimal text, never overwhelming.

## Student questions (must be answered in 2 seconds)
- What is happening today and next?
- How heavy is this week and day?
- When and where is each class or block?
- Is anything due that day?
- Do I have conflicts or gaps?

## Principles
- Glance first, then scan, then act. Default view should answer the questions above without clicks.
- Show only necessary text. Prefer icons, counts, and short labels to long descriptors.
- Color carries meaning, not decoration. Use course colors as accents, not as full backgrounds.
- Stable layout beats clever labels. Centering and alignment never shift based on density labels.
- Trust is visual. If data is missing or unconfirmed, show a clear placeholder or omit it.

## Information hierarchy
1. Term header: month or term range, total weeks, quick jump.
2. Week header row: week label + date range + compact day strip.
3. Day header row: day tiles with date and small indicators (events, assignments).
4. Grid: time axis + event blocks.
5. Secondary sections: summary cards, analytics, notes.

## Component guidance

### Day strip (week header)
- Use 2-letter abbreviations for clarity: Su, Mo, Tu, We, Th, Fr, Sa.
- Day chips stay centered within a fixed grid. No right-side labels that shift alignment.
- Count badge: neutral fill + colored ring. Text is always high contrast.
- Density meaning: use ring color + count only. Optional tooltip for light or heavy.

### Day header tiles
- Date is primary, day label secondary.
- Due indicators: small icon or dot near the date, not full text.
- Highlight current day with a subtle background and border, not a glow.

### Event blocks (classes and time blocks)
- Use solid fill with low saturation (15-25%), 1px border at 50-80% opacity.
- Title text uses neutral color; course color only for a small label or left edge.
- Show course code once; show course title once. Never repeat the same string.
- Default text stack (top to bottom):
  1) Course code or short label
  2) Course title or event title (bold)
  3) Time and location row (icons)
- If height is small, collapse to code + time only. Never wrap into 3 lines of the same value.

### Numeric badges (event counts)
- Use a contrast-safe algorithm: if background luminance < 0.5, text is white; else text is near-black.
- Keep sizes readable: min 18px, max 24px.
- Avoid tinted text on tinted backgrounds.

### Color and contrast
- No glassmorphism for primary content. Use solid surfaces.
- Avoid noisy gradients; reserve gradients for rare, high-emphasis sections.
- Ensure 4.5:1 contrast for numbers and labels that are read at a glance.
- Course colors are accents (border, dot, 3px edge), not full fills.

### Performance and consistency
- No backdrop blur on the schedule grid.
- Avoid per-cell shadows; use a single card shadow per week section.
- Virtualize or collapse non-active weeks; keep quick jump collapsible.
- Min and max time bounds must be data-driven per week so events are never clipped.

## Accuracy and data trust
- Resolve times and grouping in display timezone.
- Do not show repeated titles or codes; fall back to the syllabus title when available.
- Show due indicators only when confirmed. Avoid density text if counts are unknown.
- If data is loading, show stable skeletons to avoid layout shift.

## QA checklist
- Light and dark contrast pass for day counts and block titles.
- No day-chip alignment shifts when density changes.
- Event titles are not duplicated and match syllabus names.
- Due indicators appear on correct days.
- Min and max time bounds expand to show early and late events.
- Week collapse and quick jump toggle preserve scroll position.

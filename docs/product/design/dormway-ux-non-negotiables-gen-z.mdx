# DormWay UX Non-Negotiables (Gen Z)

A short, SoT-style sheet of UX rules for Gen Z college students. This is a design contract used to evaluate and reject UX decisions that violate core student expectations. It is not a full spec and does not override code or system SoTs.

## Scope

- Core UX rules for iPhone, iPad, and Mac.
- Control-first productivity surfaces (Today, Tasks, Schedule, Courses, Library).
- Trust, clarity, and capture speed expectations.

## Non-goals

- Visual design tokens or typography rules.
- Feature roadmap or implementation details.

## Non-Negotiable Principles

- Control over consumption: productivity surfaces must feel finite and clearable. [assumed]
- Context adapts the UI: the app should change based on time and student state. [assumed]
- Capture in under 3 seconds: if it takes longer, students abandon it. [assumed]
- Trust before delight: sync freshness, sources, and transparency are always visible. [assumed]
- Invisible AI: AI organizes work and removes friction, not hype or theater. [assumed]

## Always-True UI Rules (Do/Do Not)

Do:
- Show the next action above the fold on the Today surface. [assumed]
- Provide a clear "all set" state when actionable items are cleared. [assumed]
- Keep primary actions one tap away (add task, mark complete, open schedule). [assumed]
- Use large, thumb-friendly targets on iPhone. [assumed]
- Display data freshness ("Synced 2m ago") on core surfaces. [assumed]
- Provide immediate feedback for every action (visual + haptic where possible). [assumed]

Do not:
- Use infinite scroll feeds for core productivity views. [assumed]
- Hide key actions behind multi-step forms. [assumed]
- Over-notify or use red badge guilt loops. [assumed]
- Auto-switch modes without a visible cue or user consent. [assumed]
- Use dark patterns or unclear data usage. [assumed]

## Terminology Directive

- "Dashboard" or "Stack" for core productivity surfaces. [assumed]
- "Heads Up" for the thin, time-sensitive signal layer. [assumed]
- Avoid "feed" in student-facing copy (use only for internal pipelines). [assumed]

## Platform Rules (Minimum)

iPhone:
- Glanceable next action within 10 seconds of launch. [assumed]
- One-handed use and bottom-reachable controls. [assumed]
- Live Activities used for critical time-bound context. [assumed]

iPad:
- Multi-column layouts for planning and lecture use. [assumed]
- Pencil-first note capture and fast access to course context. [assumed]

Mac:
- Keyboard-first navigation and command search. [assumed]
- Multi-window support on the native roadmap. [assumed]
- Catalyst fixes are not a substitute for native Mac UX. [assumed]

## Trust and Risk Rules

- Spoiler-free grade reveals: the student chooses when to reveal a score. [assumed]
- Deep links to exact submission targets, not LMS home pages. [assumed]
- Transparent data sources and sync status on every key surface. [assumed]

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Social feeds in productivity contexts. [assumed]
- Guilt-driven streaks or leaderboards. [assumed]
- AI gimmicks without clear utility or sources. [assumed]
- Cluttered dashboards that hide the main action. [assumed]

## Evidence Tags

Use these tags to mark items in future specs:
- [verified] Supported by data or research.
- [assumed] Directional, requires validation.

## Shoot Priorities

### Priority 1: Essential for Deck + Demo (Shoot First)

- Founder story interview
- Product demo footage
- User testimonials

**Why First:** VCs need polished demo video and testimonials. This is non-negotiable for pitch deck.

### Priority 2: Social Media Content (Shoot After or DIY)

- Campus b-roll library
- "Day in the life" footage
- Product development montage

**Why Second:** Can be shot by Riley over time. Social media benefits from authentic/rough content.

### Priority 3: Nice-to-Have (If Budget Allows)

- Explainer animations
- Investor-specific talking heads

**Why Last:** These are polish items. Only pursue if Priority 1 and 2 are complete and budget remains.

**"The Problem I Was Solving" (1-2 min clip)**

- "83% of college students report stress from managing deadlines"
- "Canvas shows assignments but doesn't help you prioritize"
- "Syllabi are PDFs that professors email - you have to manually enter everything"
- "Students use 5+ different tools and nothing talks to each other"
- "Parents are constantly checking in because students are overwhelmed"

**"What I Learned Building DormWay" (1-2 min clip)**

- "AI-native development means a 2-person team can move at 10x speed"
- "Students don't need another app - they need intelligence that connects what they already use"
- "The viral mechanism is email: syllabus@dormway.app processes any syllabus in 30 seconds"

**Question 1: "What problem does DormWay solve for you?"**

**What We Want:**

- Concrete example of missing an assignment or feeling overwhelmed
- How they managed before (Canvas, email, manual calendar)

**What We Want:**

- Emotional reaction (this is the NPS question)
- Realization of how integrated it's become

---

**Question 4: "Would you recommend DormWay to a friend? Why?"**

**What We Want:**

- Yes/no + reasoning
- What specific friend would benefit
- How they'd describe it

---

### 3.2 Investor-Specific Talking Heads

**Only if Priority 1-2 complete and time remains**

#### Professional Setup Required

- Clean background (neutral wall, bookshelf, or campus backdrop)
- Three-point lighting (key, fill, back)
- Lapel mic
- Teleprompter or notes off-camera
- 4K camera

---

#### Video 1: "Our Vision" (2 min)

**Script:** "DormWay isn't just a productivity app. It's the academic intelligence layer for college students - free forever.

We're solving a $35 billion problem: students juggle 5+ disconnected systems just to track deadlines. Canvas doesn't talk to syllabi. Syllabi don't talk to calendars. Students are drowning in complexity.

Our vision is to become the iOS for college students - the operating system that connects everything they use. Start with academic organization, expand to campus commerce through our Campus Connect marketplace.

In 3 years, we'll power 500+ campuses with 500K students. In 10 years, we'll be the global platform for student life - high schools, international campuses, professional programs.

Every student will have DormWay. We're building that future."

**Usage:** Async intro for VCs who can't take live meetings

---

#### Video 2: "Why Now" (90 sec)

**Script:** "Four macro trends are converging right now:

First, Gen Z expects AI-first tools. 73% use AI weekly for schoolwork. DormWay is native AI from day one.

Second, Canvas has 95% market share in learning management systems. 5,000+ universities use it. That's our built-in distribution.

Third, contextual advertising is exploding. Privacy regulations killed cookie-based tracking. Advertisers need alternatives. Campus Connect solves this with zero-party data - students voluntarily share academic context.

Fourth, local merchants are underserved. $600 billion in student spending power, no effective way to reach them. Campus Connect delivers customers at moment of highest intent.

The infrastructure, the demand, and the regulatory tailwind are all aligned. This is the moment."

**Usage:** Pitch deck "Why Now" slide, investor education

---

#### Video 3: "Market Opportunity" (2 min)

**Script:** "DormWay is a two-sided marketplace disguised as a student productivity app.

On the student side: 20 million college students in the US. They check DormWay 5-10 times daily for schedules and deadlines. The product is 100% free forever. That's our viral growth engine.

On the merchant side: $600 billion in annual student spending power. Local businesses have no effective way to reach students at moment of intent. Campus advertising is broken - flyers, posters, digital boards reach students when they're not ready to buy.

Campus Connect changes that. We surface offers at moments of high intent. Student has a 10am class and walks past a coffee shop at 9:25am? Coffee shop offer appears. Student has a group project due next week? Study space recommendations appear.

Conservative market sizing: 250 merchants per campus at $500 per month average. That's $1.2 million ARR per campus. In Year 3, we target 100 campuses: $120 million ARR potential.

Students get a free product they love. Merchants pay for high-intent customers. We keep 90% margins. That's the model."

**Usage:** Investor education, pitch deck market slide

**Cost:** $500-1,500  
**ROI:** High-quality demo video worth 10x the cost in VC meetings

---

### Phase 2: Riley Shoots Social Content (Ongoing)

**Why:**

- Social media benefits from authentic/rough content
- "Building in public" content works better when self-recorded
- Can be done over time (not time-sensitive)
- Saves $1,500-2,000 vs. full professional shoot

**Cost:** $100-200 (equipment)  
**Time Investment:** 2-3 hours per week

# January 2026 Seed Round Strategy: Quality Over Scale

**Created:** November 5, 2025
**Target Close:** January 31, 2026
**Goal:** $1-2M seed round
**Strategy:** Prove product-market fit with engaged users, not vanity metrics

---

## Executive Summary

**The Challenge:** We have 8 weeks to build a credible fundraising story for a January 2026 seed round.

**The Trap to Avoid:** Mass marketing push → high signups → poor retention → VCs see red flags

**Our Strategy:** Controlled beta with 50-100 Michigan students → prove they LOVE it → raise on quality signals + **Campus Connect business model** → scale post-raise

**Why This Works:**
- Seed rounds don't require scale - they require proof of product-market fit + **clear monetization path**
- "80 students with 4.8 NPS and 70% retention" > "800 signups with 20% retention"
- **Campus Connect is a high-margin B2B marketplace disguised as a student productivity app**
- Students get 100% free product (viral growth), merchants pay for contextual access
- $12B+ TAM in campus advertising market (currently fragmented and broken)
- Protects brand reputation for post-raise growth
- De-risks the product AND the business model in VC eyes
- Sets up credible "we're ready to scale both sides" narrative

**Key Insight:** We're not raising on traction. We're raising on LOVE + **a defensible, high-margin business model that scales with network effects**.

## 🚨 THE CAMPUS CONNECT BUSINESS MODEL

**DormWay has NEVER been a freemium app.** The Campus Connect model (see `Architecture/Campus Connect Whitepaper.md`) has always been our core monetization strategy:

- **Students:** 100% free forever (syllabus parsing, Canvas sync, AI assistant, all features)
- **Merchants:** Pay $200-3,000/month per location for contextual placement at moments of high intent
- **Revenue Model:** B2B marketplace with 90% gross margins
- **Market Validation:** Campus advertising is multi-billion dollar market with zero effective solutions

This is the story we tell VCs: **"We're building the academic intelligence layer for students (free), which creates the highest-quality intent signals for campus merchants (paid). Students love it because it's genuinely useful. Merchants pay because we deliver customers at the moment of highest intent."**

### **Slide 1: Cover**
- DormWay logo
- "Your college life, organized"
- Riley Crimmins, Founder
- January 2026

---

### **Slide 2: The Problem (Pain Point)**

**Visual:** Chaotic screenshot showing Canvas + Google Cal + Email + PDF syllabi all open

**Text:**
> "College students juggle 5+ systems to track deadlines.
>
> Result: Missed assignments, constant stress, parents micromanaging
>
> I couldn't balance streaming (100K followers) and Michigan coursework because of this chaos."

**Data Point:** "83% of college students report stress from managing deadlines" (cite source if you have it, or use testimonial)

---

### **Slide 3: The Solution**

**Visual:** DormWay dashboard screenshot

**Text:**
> "DormWay: Your AI-powered academic assistant
>
> - Email your syllabus → AI extracts everything in 30 seconds
> - Connect Canvas → All assignments sync automatically
> - Unified dashboard → See everything in one place
> - AI assistant → Chat with your course materials"

**Tagline:** "Canvas + Calendar + Syllabus + AI = DormWay"

---

### **Slide 4: The Product (Demo Visuals)**

**3-4 screenshots showing:**
1. Syllabus upload flow
2. Dashboard with assignments
3. AI chat interface
4. Grade calculator

**Keep text minimal** - let visuals speak

---

### **Slide 5: Early Traction (THE MONEY SLIDE)**

**Headline:** "We Proved Students Love It (Not Just Use It)"

**Metrics Box:**
```
Private Beta (Nov-Dec 2025) - University of Michigan

📊 80 active students
⭐ 4.8/5.0 NPS score
🔁 72% weekly retention (after 6 weeks)
⚡ 99.6% uptime
⏰ Students save 5+ hours/week (self-reported)
💬 "I'd be devastated if this disappeared"
```

**Below metrics:** 3 killer testimonial quotes with student photos (if allowed)

**Bottom text:** *"We kept it small to nail product-market fit. Now we're ready to scale."*

---

### **Slide 6: Market Opportunity**

**Visual:** Two-sided marketplace diagram (Students ↔ Merchants)

**Student Side:**
- 🎓 **19.3M college students** in the US
- 📚 **5,000+ universities** use Canvas (built-in integration)
- 📱 **Daily engagement:** Students check DormWay 5-10× daily for schedules/deadlines
- 🌍 **International expansion:** 30M+ students globally

**Merchant Side (The Real Money):**
- 💰 **$600B+ annual student spending power** ($78.3B on food alone)
- 🏪 **Fragmented local market:** Campus advertising is multi-billion dollar opportunity
- 📉 **Current inefficiency:** Flyers, posters, digital boards reach students at moments of LOW intent
- 🎯 **Campus Connect advantage:** Contextual triggers surface offers at moments of HIGH intent

**TAM/SAM/SOM:**
- TAM: Multi-billion dollar campus advertising market (no centralized data available)
- SAM: $12B (250 merchants × 500 major campuses × $4.8K average annual spend)
- SOM: $120M ARR (100 campuses at $1.2M ARR each by Year 3)

---

### **Slide 7: Business Model**

**Primary Revenue: Campus Connect (B2B Merchant Platform)**

DormWay is **NOT a freemium app.** It's a **contextual sponsorship platform** that keeps the student experience 100% free while monetizing through merchant partnerships.

**How It Works:**
- Students get DormWay completely free (syllabus parsing, Canvas sync, AI assistant, all features)
- Local businesses pay to surface contextually relevant offers at moments of high intent
- Example: Coffee shop offer appears when student has 10am class and walks past at 9:25am. Or a DoorDash coupon if we can tell they need to pull an all-nighter.

**Revenue Tiers:**
- **Tier 1: Contextual Listings** ($200-500/month per location)
  - Merchant appears in relevant contextual moments
  - Basic analytics dashboard

- **Tier 2: Sponsored Positioning** ($500-1,500/month per location)
  - Priority placement in contextual suggestions
  - A/B testing capabilities
  - Student preference insights (anonymized)

- **Tier 3: Campus Deals Platform** ($1,500-3,000/month per location)
  - Full marketplace integration
  - Dynamic pricing based on demand signals
  - Closed-loop attribution tracking

**Market Sizing (Conservative):**
- 250 merchants per campus @ $500/mo avg = $1.2M ARR per campus
- Year 1: 10 pilot campuses = $12M ARR potential
- Year 3: 100 campuses = $120M ARR potential

**Why This Works:**
- Zero student friction (free = viral growth)
- Privacy-preserving (no PII shared with merchants)
- Higher CAC efficiency than social ads ($12 vs $18-27)
- 90% gross margins (pure software)

**LTV/CAC Target:** Merchant LTV >$10K, CAC <$2K = 5:1 ratio

---

### **Slide 8: Go-To-Market Strategy**

**Two-Sided Launch (Students + Merchants in Parallel)**

**Phase 1 (Post-Raise): Michigan Proof of Concept (Months 1-3)**

*Student Side:*
- Scale from 80 → 2,000 students at U-M
- Riley reactivates social channels (100K followers)
- Campus partnerships (post in U-M student groups)
- Target: 10% of U-M student body

*Merchant Side:*
- Recruit 5 pilot merchants in Ann Arbor (coffee, print, office supply)
- Free for first 3 months (prove ROI)
- Build merchant dashboard + analytics
- Case studies: "3-5× better ROI than flyers/social ads"

**Phase 2: Multi-Campus Expansion (Months 4-9)**
- 10 additional universities (prioritize large Canvas schools)
- 50 merchants per campus (250 merchants × $500 avg = $125K MRR)
- Student ambassador program (1 per campus)
- Merchant self-service onboarding platform
- Target: 10,000 students, $1.5M ARR

**Phase 3: National Scale (Months 10-18)**
- 100+ campuses nationwide
- 2,500+ merchants paying ($1.25M MRR = $15M ARR)
- Automated merchant bidding system
- Predictive demand forecasting for merchants
- Target: 100,000 students, $15M ARR

---

### **Slide 9: Competitive Landscape**

**Visual:** 2x2 matrix

**Axes:**
- X-axis: Student Tools → Two-Sided Marketplace
- Y-axis: Generic Ads → Contextual Intelligence

**Competitors Positioned:**
- **Canvas LMS:** (Student Tools, Manual) - "No monetization, no merchant access"
- **Google/Facebook Ads:** (Generic Ads, Two-Sided) - "Spray-and-pray, no academic context"
- **Yelp/Campus Flyers:** (Generic Ads, Manual) - "Zero timing intelligence"
- **Traditional campus marketing:** (Manual, Manual) - "Broken attribution"

**DormWay Campus Connect:** (Contextual Intelligence, Two-Sided Marketplace) - Upper right quadrant

**Our Moat:**
- **Zero-party data architecture:** Students voluntarily share academic context (no creepy tracking)
- **Academic intelligence layer:** Syllabus parsing creates intent signals no one else has
- **Closed-loop attribution:** Track suggestion → visit → purchase (merchants love this)
- **Anti-commoditization:** Surface merchants in specific contexts, not generic search
- **Network effects:** More students = smarter matching = better merchant ROI

---

### **Slide 10: Why Now**

**Four Macro Trends:**

1. **Gen Z Expects AI-First Tools**
   - 73% of Gen Z uses AI weekly for schoolwork
   - DormWay is native AI experience

2. **Canvas Has 95% Market Share in LMS**
   - 5,000+ universities on Canvas
   - Built-in distribution channel to students

3. **Contextual Advertising Is Exploding**
   - Privacy regulations killing cookie-based tracking (GDPR, CCPA)
   - Contextual ads show 43% higher neural engagement (GumGum study)
   - Advertisers desperate for alternatives to Facebook/Google
   - **Campus Connect solves this with zero-party data**

4. **Local Merchants Are Underserved**
   - $600B+ student spending power
   - No effective way to reach students at moment of intent
   - Traditional campus advertising (flyers, digital boards) is broken
   - Merchants paying $18-27 CAC on social ads vs. $12 with contextual

**Bottom line:** "The infrastructure (Canvas), the demand (Gen Z), and the regulatory tailwind (privacy-first advertising) are all aligned. Campus Connect is the future of campus monetization."

## Positioning Campus Connect to VCs

### **The Narrative Arc**

**Don't lead with:** "We're a campus advertising platform"
**Do lead with:** "We're the academic intelligence layer for college students"

**Then reveal:** "That intelligence creates the highest-quality intent signals in the campus market, which we monetize through contextual sponsorships"

### **Positioning by VC Type**

**Education-Focused VCs (Reach Capital, Owl Ventures):**
- Lead with student value: "Free academic assistant that students genuinely need"
- Then: "Which creates defensible moat for B2B monetization"
- Emphasize: Zero-party data (students voluntarily share context) vs. surveillance capitalism

**Consumer/Platform VCs (Lightspeed, Homebrew):**
- Lead with marketplace dynamics: "Two-sided network effects"
- Then: "More students = better intent signals = better merchant ROI = more merchants = more value to students"
- Emphasize: 90% gross margins, B2B SaaS-like retention

**Midwest VCs (Wolverine, Hyde Park):**
- Lead with local angle: "Built at Michigan, for Michigan—now scaling nationally"
- Then: "Revitalizing campus commerce by connecting local businesses to students"
- Emphasize: Job creation, supporting local economies

### **Objection Handling**

**"How is this different from Facebook/Google Ads?"**
- "They track behavior. We use zero-party data—students tell us what they're working on."
- "They spray ads everywhere. We surface offers at moment of highest intent."
- "They compete on price. We create context-specific demand."

**"Why wouldn't students turn off ads?"**
- "They're not ads—they're contextually relevant suggestions. Like 'You have a group project due—here are study spaces nearby.'"
- "Students control what categories they see. Max 2 suggestions per academic event."
- "Quality threshold: Only merchants with >4.2 stars."

**"What's stopping bigger players from copying you?"**
- "Canvas integration took 6 months to build. Not trivial."
- "Syllabus parsing requires proprietary AI crews. Not off-the-shelf."
- "Network effects: More students = smarter matching = harder to displace."
- "First-mover advantage: We're defining the category."

## Content Strategy (Riley's Channels)

**Goal:** Build Riley's founder brand → attract inbound VC interest → show product progress

**NOT the goal:** Massive user signups (yet)

---

### **TikTok Strategy (58K followers)**

**Post 1 (Week 1): The Return**
```
Hook: "I disappeared from the internet for 6 months. Here's why."

Script:
- Used to stream full-time (show old clips)
- Couldn't manage streaming + college chaos
- Missing classes, missing assignments
- So I learned to code
- Built something to fix it
- Now testing with 50 Michigan students
- More to come...

CTA: "Follow for the journey"
```

**Post 2 (Week 3): The Problem**
```
Hook: "Here's why college productivity is broken"

Show:
- Canvas screenshot (messy)
- Email screenshot (syllabus PDFs)
- Google Calendar (empty)
- Confused student (you)

Text overlay: "There has to be a better way"

CTA: "Building that better way. Part 2 coming."
```

**Post 3 (Week 5): Early Traction**
```
Hook: "We tested this with real students. Here's what happened."

Share:
- "50 Michigan students using it"
- User testimonial quote (animated text)
- Dashboard demo (5-10 seconds)
- "More soon"

CTA: "Interested? Comment 'beta' below"
```

**Cadence:** 1 video per week (not overwhelming, builds anticipation)

**Tone:** Behind-the-scenes, founder story, humble progress updates

---

### **Instagram Strategy**

**Story Series: "Building DormWay"**
- Screenshot of code
- Late-night work sessions
- User feedback messages
- Testimonial quotes
- "80 students now using it"

**Feed Posts:**
- Milestones ("Hit 50 beta users!")
- Product screenshots
- User testimonials (with permission)

**Cadence:** Stories 3-4x per week, Feed 1-2x per month

---

### **Twitter/X Strategy**

**Thread 1 (Week 2):**
```
I stopped streaming 6 months ago to build something.

Not because I wanted to—because I had no choice.

Streaming + college was impossible. I kept missing classes.

The problem? Canvas, PDFs, emails, calendars—all disconnected.

So I learned to code and built DormWay. Here's what it does 🧵

[Continue with product demo, end with "Testing with 50 Michigan students now"]
```

**Thread 2 (Week 6):**
```
Update on DormWay:

- 80 Michigan students using it
- 4.8/5 rating from beta users
- "This saved my semester" - actual quote
- Raising a seed round to scale

Here's what I learned about building for students 🧵

[Share lessons learned, end with "Open to VC intros - DM me"]
```

**Cadence:** 1 thread every 2 weeks

---

### **Twitch Strategy (13.5K followers)**

**Comeback Stream (Week 3):**
- **Title:** "I'm back + I built something"
- **Format:**
  - First 15 min: Story time (why I left, what I built)
  - Next 15 min: Live DormWay demo
  - Rest: Normal gaming/chatting
- **Throughout:** "Type !dormway for more info"

**Monthly Streams (Dec-Jan):**
- Don't make it about DormWay every stream
- Just use it on stream naturally ("Let me check what's due tomorrow")
- Viewers see it in action organically

**Cadence:** 1 stream per week (rebuild consistency)

## Risk Mitigation

### **Risk 1: Can't get to 80 beta users**

**Mitigation:**
- Expand recruitment beyond friends (post in U-M subreddit, Facebook groups)
- Offer incentives (free premium for beta users)
- Lower the bar slightly (accept 60-70 users if highly engaged)

**Fallback:** "We kept it small intentionally" still works with 50 engaged users if metrics are strong

---

### **Risk 2: Retention is lower than expected (<60%)**

**Mitigation:**
- Identify WHY users aren't returning (exit interviews)
- Fix the #1 churn reason immediately
- Focus on weekly (not daily) retention as success metric

**Fallback:** "Early retention challenges are normal for beta; here's how we're fixing it"

---

### **Risk 3: Critical bug during fundraising**

**Mitigation:**
- No deploys during critical VC meeting weeks
- Have Ethan on standby for immediate fixes
- Communicate proactively with users if issues arise

**Fallback:** "We had an incident, here's how we handled it in 2 hours" (shows operational maturity)

---

### **Risk 4: VCs want more users before investing**

**Mitigation:**
- Emphasize quality over quantity (NPS, retention)
- Show clear growth plan post-raise (how you'll get to 10K students in 6 months)
- Offer to do rolling close (raise partial round now, more later)

**Fallback:** Consider raising smaller round ($500K-$750K) from angels/Dorm Room Fund to hit milestones, then raise larger round

---

### **Risk 5: Can't close by January 31**

**Mitigation:**
- Start outreach early (mid-December)
- Run a tight process (2 weeks from intro to decision)
- Be willing to close with first solid term sheet (don't over-optimize)

**Fallback:** Extend timeline to mid-February, focus on runway management

## Final Thoughts: Why This Will Work

**VCs don't need you to have scale at seed. They need you to have:**

1. ✅ **Clear problem** - College productivity is broken (you lived it)
2. ✅ **Compelling founder** - Riley's story is authentic and differentiated
3. ✅ **Working product** - DormWay is real and functional
4. ✅ **Early validation** - 80 students with high NPS proves love
5. ✅ **Massive market** - $12B+ campus advertising market (TAM) + 20M students
6. ✅ **Defensible moat** - Canvas integration, AI crews, zero-party data, network effects
7. ✅ **Clear path to scale** - Two-sided growth: students (Riley's 100K followers) + merchants (B2B sales)
8. ✅ **High-margin business model** - 90% gross margins, B2B SaaS-like retention, no student acquisition cost

**The Campus Connect advantage:**
- Students get 100% free product (removes adoption friction)
- Merchants pay for what they actually want (high-intent customers)
- You keep 90% of revenue (pure software margins)
- Network effects on both sides (more students = better merchant ROI = more merchants = more value)

**You have all of this.** Now it's about execution and storytelling.

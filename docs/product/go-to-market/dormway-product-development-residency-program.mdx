- 20+ different LMS configurations validated
- 10+ different campus environments documented

**Engagement:**

- 80%+ resident retention through Week 10
- 60%+ attendance at weekly office hours
- 50%+ engagement in Slack discussions

**Product Readiness:**

- Zero critical bugs at launch
- <5 high-severity bugs at launch
- Comprehensive test coverage documentation

### **Qualitative**

**Resident Experience:**

- Exit survey: 8/10+ satisfaction rating
- 50%+ would recommend program to peers
- 70%+ report learning valuable technical skills
- 10+ residents become active platform evangelists

**Product Insights:**

- Identify 3+ major feature gaps before launch
- Validate product-market fit across diverse campuses
- Build understanding of edge cases and platform limitations

**Network Effects:**

- 20 residents = 20 different campus networks seeded
- Each resident brings 5-10 friends to platform organically
- Word-of-mouth amplification ahead of January GTM

## Risk Mitigation

### **Potential Issues**

**1. Low Application Quality**

- Mitigation: Lower bar to 15 residents if necessary, focus on diversity of campuses
- Backup: Direct recruit from Riley's Twitch community and known networks

**2. Poor Engagement/Dropout**

- Mitigation: Weekly check-ins with less active residents, understand blockers
- Backup: Accept rolling applications to backfill if someone drops

**3. Overwhelming Bug Volume**

- Mitigation: Clear bug severity guidelines, automated duplicate detection
- Strategy: Weekly triage sessions, prioritize critical/high severity

**4. Infrastructure Not Ready**

- Mitigation: Staged rollout - start with 5 residents Week 1, expand if stable
- Backup: Delay program start by 1 week if critical issues found

**5. Founder Time Constraints**

- Mitigation: Pre-record some content, make more async
- Backup: Scale back office hours frequency if necessary

## Launch Announcement Copy

### **Hacker News Post**

**Title**: "Show HN: Product Development Residency - Learn AI-native development at college platform startup"

**Body**:

```
We're DormWay - building the iOS for college students. Two founders (CTO with 30 years in tech, former Twitch streamer who learned to code building this) shipping an AI-native platform using SwiftUI, TypeScript, Temporal, and heavy agentic AI.

We're opening a 10-week Product Development Residency for 20 technical students starting Nov 18. You'll:

- See our real development workflow: Claude Code prompts, architecture decisions, mistakes
- Weekly office hours with founders discussing technical choices being made that week
- Access to our full dev environment and AI tooling
- File bugs, suggest features, break things before 100K students do
- Build portfolio evidence and get professional references

We need people putting this through its paces across different campuses before our January launch. In exchange, you learn how a 2-person team ships at 10x speed using AI-native development.

Looking for students who've shipped side projects, contribute to OSS, or have strong technical curiosity. iPhone required (testing iOS app). 5-8 hours/week commitment.

### **Reddit Post (r/csMajors)**

**Title**: "Product Development Residency at AI startup - actually learn something useful (not free QA labor)"

**Body**:

```
Not a typical "beta tester" thing. This is structured, time-boxed (10 weeks), with real learning outcomes.

Background: We're building DormWay, an AI-powered college productivity platform. 2 founders, all-in on agentic AI, shipping fast. CTO has 30 years in tech (Universal Audio, Fender, Live Nation), other founder learned to code while building this (former Twitch streamer).

The Deal:
- 10 weeks, 5-8 hours/week, Nov 18 - Jan 27
- Weekly office hours with founders on actual product decisions
- Access to our development environment (Claude Code, Temporal workflows, AI setup)
- Private Slack with real-time updates on what we're building and why
- You file bugs, suggest features, break things before launch
- Portfolio evidence, professional references, hiring pipeline access

What You'll Learn:
- AI-native development methodology (our actual prompts and workflows)
- How to ship products with minimal resources using AI tools
- Technical decision-making in fast-moving startup
- SwiftUI, TypeScript, Temporal, agentic AI in production

Requirements:
- Technical background (side projects, hackathons, OSS contributions)
- iPhone (testing iOS app)
- Ability to communicate technical issues clearly
- Actually want to learn, not just pad resume

We're only taking 20 people. First qualified applicants accepted.

Apply: [link]

This is reciprocal value - you're not free QA, you're learning something rare (how to build with AI at 10x speed) in exchange for helping us validate before scaling.

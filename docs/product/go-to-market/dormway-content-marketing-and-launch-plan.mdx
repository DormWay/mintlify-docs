### Press Release (Draft Structure)

HEADLINE: DormWay Launches Free App to Help College Students Never Miss a Deadline

SUBHEAD: Student-founded startup combines Canvas integration, AI syllabus parsing, 
and 24/7 academic assistant to tackle the platform fragmentation overwhelming 
20 million US college students

[City, Date] — DormWay, an AI-powered academic operating system, launches today 
on iOS to help college students manage their coursework across a unified platform.

THE PROBLEM (with stats):
- 77% of students report being overwhelmed by academic technology
- Average student juggles 12-15 different platforms
- Only 41% graduate in 4 years; 24% don't return after freshman year

THE SOLUTION:
- Connect Canvas once, see all assignments
- Email syllabus to syllabus@dormway.app, dates extracted automatically
- Ace AI assistant available 24/7 for academic questions

FOUNDER QUOTE (Riley):
"I built DormWay because I was drowning in tabs and missed deadlines like every 
other student. The tools exist to fix this—colleges just haven't connected them."

FOUNDER QUOTE (Ethan):
"After 30 years in consumer tech, I've never seen a market this underserved. 
Students deserve the same quality software experience as everyone else."

AVAILABILITY:
- Free on iOS App Store
- Android coming Q1 2025
- Works with any Canvas-integrated institution

ABOUT DORMWAY:
DormWay is the academic operating system for college students, founded by 
University of Michigan student Riley Crimmins and tech veteran Ethan Kaplan. 
The company has built its platform for under $100K and serves students at 
6,200+ institutions nationwide. Learn more at dormway.com.

|Founder personal posts|-|✓|✓|Riley/Ethan|Jan 6|

- Ethan on LinkedIn: The experienced operator joining a student founder

These get shared by press and noticed by investors more than brand accounts.

## Key Narrative Points (For All Content)

### The Story

- Student founder (Riley) drowning in tabs and missed deadlines
- Veteran operator (Ethan) sees massive underserved market
- Built entire platform for &lt;$100K with two people
- Now serving 6,200+ institutions

### The Problem (Quotable Stats)

- 77% of students overwhelmed by academic technology
- Average student uses 12-15 different platforms
- Only 41% graduate in 4 years
- 24% don't return after freshman year
- 67% work while enrolled, can't make office hours

### The Solution (Simple)

- Connect Canvas once
- Email your syllabus

- 24/7 AI help when office hours don't work

### The Differentiator

- "Student-outward" not "campus-downward" (no institutional sales cycles)
- Built for ALL students (commuters, workers, parents—not just traditional campus)
- Anti-engagement design (help students win, then put phone down)

### The Market

- 20M college students in US
- $35B TAM
- Only 15-16% live on campus—everyone else is underserved

## What's Still NOT Required for Launch

Even with PR and fundraising, these can wait:

|Don't Build Yet|Why|
|---|---|
|Full email sequences beyond welcome|Build from observed behavior|
|Ambassador program|No ambassadors yet|
|Paid ads|Don't spend before PMF confirmed|
|Multiple tutorial videos|See what questions come in first|
|Elaborate help docs|Write as questions repeat|
|Second press release|Wait for meaningful milestone|

---

## Summary: The Difference

**Pure soft launch (previous):** 10 items, validate product works

**Launch + Fundraising + PR (now):** ~25 items across three tracks

|Track|Key Assets|
|---|---|
|User acquisition|App Store polished, landing page, social posts|
|Press|Press kit, press release, founder stories, headshots, stats|
|Investor|Polished presence, metrics ready, professional first impression|

The website and App Store presence now need to look like a real company, not a weekend project. Press needs assets to write about you. Investors will Google you and sign up to test—make both experiences good.

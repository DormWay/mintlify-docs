# DormWay Cofounder Handoff — Positioning, Build Plan, and Changes since v1

**Date:** 2025‑09‑26  
**Owner:** Riley  
**Context:** This replaces the older “OS for College Life” framing in the screenshots. It clarifies _what we’re shipping now_, why, and how it differs from the last public positioning.

---

## TL;DR

- **Promise (headline):** _Know what's next
    
- **Model (UI):** **Do Now · Up Next · Due Soon** (natural language; zero acronyms).
    
- **Proof:** We read syllabi, sync your calendar, and respect campus breaks to keep one living plan current.
    
- **Metric:** One‑question **Clarity Quiz** before/after setup; we report clarity delta and celebrate “Way better than last time you asked.”
    
- **Focus:** Ship the lane experience + clarity measurement first; everything else supports that.
    

---

## Positioning (what we say)

**Eyebrow:** _The student operating system_ (quiet, optional).

**H1:** **Always know what to do next.**  
**Sub:** _We pull from your syllabi and calendar to show what’s_ **_Do Now_**_,_ **_Up Next_**_, and_ **_Due Soon_** _— and keep it up to date around campus breaks._  
**Primary CTA:** **Build My Plan**  
**Trust chip (once):** _Read‑only • You’re in control_


**Microcopy:**

- _Your plan writes itself._
    
- _Announcements become actions._
    
- _Source:_ Syllabus • Calendar • University • Canvas (beta)
    

**DW motif (sparingly):** _DW: Don’t Worry. Do What’s Next._ (footer/easter egg, not hero)

---

## What we’re building (not just syllabus analysis)

**Goal:** A live plan that keeps three lanes current using multiple inputs with student approval.

**Core system = Plan Orchestration:**

1. **Ingest**
    
    - Syllabi (professor, meetings, rooms, due dates, topics)
        
    - Calendars (Google/Apple; export today, full sync on roadmap)
        
    - University calendar (breaks/holidays; optional campus feeds)
        
    - Canvas (beta announcements → actions)
        
2. **Normalize & reconcile**
    
    - Detect conflicts; surface **Conflict pill** → _Review (Keep Syllabus / Keep Canvas)_
        
    - Show **Source chips** on every item (trust by default)
        
3. **Assign to lanes (rules shipped):**
    
    - **Do Now:** due **today/overdue** + **in‑session** items
        
    - **Up Next:** **rest of today** + **early tomorrow**
        
    - **Due Soon:** due **within 7 days** (configurable), excluding items already in Do/Next
        
4. **Surface & act**
    
    - Three‑lane dashboard, tiny lane tooltips with rules
        
    - **Quick Commands (⌘K / Ctrl‑K):** “What’s due Friday?” (MVP)
        
    - **Class Start Panel** (room, route, links) — staged if needed

## Build plan (phased, outcome‑led)

**Phase 1 — Outcome & measurement (ship now)**

- Landing hero swap + trust chip
    
- Three‑lane UI with tooltips + color tokens (calm palette)
    
- Source chips; Conflict pill (basic two‑choice resolver)
    
- **Clarity Quiz**
    
    - _Before:_ Yes / No / I think so
        
    - _After:_ Yes / No / I think so / **Way better than last time you asked**
        
    - 7‑day cool‑down; settings toggle: “Don’t ask again this term.”
        
- Metrics plumbing: capture `clarity_before/after`, DAU 9p‑12a, both‑source activation
    

**Phase 2 — Inputs & commands (next)**

- Canvas (beta) → announcements → **Add to plan** (2 taps)
    
- University calendar auto‑apply (breaks/holidays)
    
- **Quick Commands MVP** (jump, due‑filters, “What’s due Friday?”)
    

**Phase 3 — Depth & mobile (following)**

- Calendar two‑way niceties, better conflict heuristics
    
- Class Start Panel; study block nudges around breaks
    
- Mobile waitlist → app previews (same three lanes)
    

> **Out‑of‑scope for now:** social features, grade tracking, heavy note‑taking, file storage (unless directly supporting lanes).

## What changed since the screenshots (diff)

**Positioning & narrative**

- From **“The OS for College Life”** → **Outcome‑first:** _Always know what to do next._
    
- “Syllabus analysis” framed as **plumbing**, not the product; multi‑source orchestration emphasized but kept out of the headline.
    
- Added **Do Now · Up Next · Due Soon** buckets; removed acronyms (no NND).
    
- DW wordplay kept only as subtle motif (no longer center stage).
    

**Homepage & IA**

- Hero copy + CTA unified around **Build My Plan**; added one‑line definition of the OS under hero (optional).
    
- Reframed stats: big, credible numbers first; “This week” counters secondary.
    
- New **Connectors band** → Canvas (beta), Screenshot → .ics, and roadmap chips; added one‑line **control** message by connectors.
    
- Preview card tuned as proof engine (Up next, Estimated difficulty, Source chip, rotating).
    
- Added **FAQ strip** with cost/account/privacy/roadmap.
    
- Cleaned microcopy for anxiety (avoid “ingest,” “autopilot,” “digital twin”).
    

**Product behavior**

- Lane rules made explicit with tooltips; configurable “Due Soon” window.
    
- **Source chips** and **Conflict pill** interactions for trust without paragraphs.
    
- Quick Commands labeled for both platforms (**⌘K / Ctrl‑K**).
    
- Optional **time format toggle** (12h/24h) and schedule polish.
    

**Measurement**

- Introduced **Clarity Quiz** (before/after) as the activation metric.
    
- Defined headline stat for site: _“After setup,_ **_87%_** _say they know what to do next.”_
    
- Core KPI set trimmed to three: clarity improvement, 9pm‑midnight DAU, both‑source activation.

## Copy blocks (paste‑ready)

**Hero**

> **Always know what to do next.**  
> We pull from your syllabi and calendar to show what’s **Do Now**, **Up Next**, and **Due Soon** — and keep it up to date around campus breaks.  
> **Build My Plan**  
> _Read‑only • You’re in control_

**Lane tooltips**

- Do Now: _Due today/overdue + in‑session items._
    
- Up Next: _Rest of today + early tomorrow._
    
- Due Soon: _Due within 7 days (excluding items already in other lanes)._
    

**Clarity Quiz (after)**  
Options: _Yes • No • I think so •_ **_Way better than last time you asked_**

---

## Metrics & reporting

- **Clarity lift:** %(`after` in {yes, way_better}) − %(`before` in {yes})
    
- **Headline:** %(`after` in {yes, way_better}) → site band + investor slide
    
- **Guardrails:** only count users who answered both within 24h; cohort by campus/term
    

**Impact report template (example):**

```
DormWay Impact — Fall 2025
Students surveyed: 10,000
Question: “Do you know what to do next for your classes?”

Before:
- Yes 23% • I think so 41% • No 36%
After:
- Yes 52% • Way better 35% • I think so 11% • No 2%
Result: 64% absolute improvement in academic clarity — in under 60 seconds.
```

---

## Risks & mitigations

- **Lane confusion** → ship tooltips + let users adjust Due‑Soon window.
    
- **Over‑promise** → label Canvas as _(beta)_; keep OS term as eyebrow.
    
- **Privacy anxiety** → show control via chips & “Approve” flows; say “Read‑only” once.
    
- **Creepy terms** → banned list: _ingest, digital twin, autopilot_.

## Immediate actions (owner → task)

## Slack preface (2‑liner to send with this doc)

“Big clarity unlock. New promise is **Always know what to do next** with **Do Now · Up Next · Due Soon**. Shipping a one‑question **clarity quiz** before/after setup and using the delta as our activation metric. Doc has the build plan + diffs from the last site.”

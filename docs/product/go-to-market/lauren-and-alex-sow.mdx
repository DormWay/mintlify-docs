# Role #1: Campus Ambassador Recruitment & Direct Outreach Lead (Alex)

## Mission

Recruit **one high-quality ambassador per campus** who drives schedule uploads through their network, while coordinating campus expansion through the Campus Outreach CRM. Turn targeted campus presence into **first actions** (schedule uploaded via ICS or syllabus forwarded).

**Note:** DormWay uses the term "ambassadors" (not "advocates") to match our existing GetAmbassador.com integration and database schema.

## Day-to-Day Responsibilities

### Daily Activities (1.5-2 hours/day, 5 days/week)

#### Monday (2 hours)
**8:00-9:00 AM: Campus Ambassador Scouting**
- **Target 2-3 new campuses per week** (prioritize large state schools: UMich, MSU, OSU, Penn State, etc.)
- For each campus, identify ONE ideal ambassador using these methods:
  - Check existing DormWay signups for power users from that campus (most active, most engaged)
  - Search student government Instagram accounts (SGA president, VP, social chairs)
  - Find campus micro-influencers (500+ followers, high engagement, student-focused content)
  - Identify org leaders (Greek life presidents, club founders, RA coordinators)
- Research each candidate: Instagram/TikTok profile, LinkedIn, public campus involvement
- Build shortlist of 3-5 candidates per campus (add to Notion)

**9:00-10:00 AM: Weekly Planning**
- Review last week's scoreboard: Ambassadors onboarded, Schedule uploads per ambassador, WFAU by campus

  - Track referral activity in Notion: unique link clicks → schedule uploads → WFAU
  - Answer ambassador questions (payment, product setup, who to target on campus)
  - Send weekly reminder: "Your goal: 5 schedule uploads this week = $X payout"

**Afternoon Block (45 min): Campus Outreach & Expansion**

#### Friday (2 hours)

  - Track by ambassador: total referrals → uploads → earnings
  - Update Notion Ambassador Database with weekly earnings
- Send payment summary to Riley for approval
- Process payments via Venmo/PayPal (batched weekly or monthly if <$50)
- **Performance review:**

  1. **Idea:** What you want to do
  2. **Who:** Target audience
  3. **Why now:** Specific trigger or opportunity
  4. **Cost/time:** Budget and hours (must be ≤1 day of work)
  5. **Success = WFAU or campaign:** How we'll measure it

## Weekly Cadence

**Monday:**

- **Reach** (number: people contacted or exposed)
- **Clicks** (number: clicked link or engaged)
- **Signups** (number: created account)
- **WFAU** (number: completed first action in 7 days)
- **Day-7 Return** (number: came back on day 7)
- **Day-7 Return %** (formula)

# FAQ

## What if we can't hit the WFAU targets?
If you're putting in the hours and following the process but targets aren't being met, we'll adjust tactics weekly (that's the "kill what doesn't work" principle). Non-renewal only happens if there's no effort or no improvement after multiple iterations.

## What if an ambassador violates guidelines?
Pause their account immediately, document the violation in Notion, and notify Riley same-day. Depending on severity (false claims, harassment, etc.), we may terminate the ambassador relationship.

## What if a campus campaign goes badly?
Document what happened (feedback, complaints, confusion). Add to "What We Learned" section in dormway-admin notes or Notion. Use it to improve the next campaign. Bad campaigns are data, not failure.

## Can we test ideas outside the approved assets?
Yes, but only after quick-review from Riley (same-day turnaround). Post your idea in #growth-copy with context: "Want to test [X] because [Y]. OK to ship?"

## What if we need more than 15 hours/week?
Check in with Riley before going over 15 hours. If the work is driving WFAU, we can discuss increasing hours or adding a third person. Don't silently over-work.

## What's the ceiling on this role?
If you crush the 4-week pilot and keep the scoreboard green, this can grow into a full-time role (salaried) or evolve into a campus lead position managing other campus ambassadors. Prove the model, then we scale you with it.

# Send-Along Blurb (to Alex & Lauren)

> We're bringing you both on as a lean **Growth Duo** focused on one outcome: **Weekly First-Action Users** (students who upload their schedule within 7 days). **Alex**, you'll recruit and manage **one high-quality ambassador per campus** (paid $5 per schedule upload referral) while tracking campus expansion in our **Campus Outreach CRM**—identifying which campuses have coverage, which need ambassadors, and coordinating targeted campaigns. **Lauren**, you'll manage the **DormWay Labs** program (W2 employees who help with QA, syllabus gathering, and data quality—you assign work and verify quality, payroll handled in Gusto) while optimizing lifecycle emails to convert signups. You'll have **freedom with a few rails**: truthful claims only, approved assets/voice, and a quick thumbs-up from Riley for any new public copy. It's **$20/hr, 10-15 hrs/week**, a **4-week paid pilot**, then we renew monthly off the scoreboard. You'll work in **dormway-admin** with full access to Ambassadors, Labs, Campus Outreach, and Growth Scoreboard dashboards. If a bet moves first-actions, it lives; if not, we kill it and try the next idea—no drama, no heavy meetings. Let's prove this model works, then scale it together.

# Internal (for Ethan) — Why this plan

**Goal:** prove adoption with minimal burn while you two keep shipping.

- **Two hires, one metric:** both roles drive **Weekly First-Action Users (WFAU)** — # of new students who **forward a syllabus** or **import an ICS** within 7 days.
    
- **30-day objective:** **4 class/org pilots** across ≥3 campuses that create **~125 WFAU** total with **≥20% day-7 return** in those cohorts. If a tactic doesn’t move WFAU, we kill it next week.
    
- **Engagement model:** 1099, **$20/hr**, **10–15 hrs/wk**, 4-week paid pilot → month-to-month renewal based on the scoreboard.
    
- **Guardrails:** truthful claims only — “**Web app live today; campus-specific features unlock as adoption grows. Current inputs: ICS + [syllabus@dormway.app](mailto:syllabus@dormway.app)**.” New public copy requires same-day thumbs-up from Riley. No scraping; opt-outs respected.
    

Founder overhead: one **25-minute weekly stand-up** + async comments in Notion. That’s it.

# JD #1 — Student **Outreach & Social Ops Lead** (Alex)

**Type:** 1099 contractor  
**Comp:** **$20/hr** · **10–15 hrs/wk** · initial **4-week pilot**, then monthly renewal  
**Reports to:** Riley (CEO/Product)  
**Location:** Remote or Ann Arbor

## Mission

Get DormWay in front of the right students and classes **this week**, and turn that into **first actions** (syllabus forwarded / ICS imported).

## What you’ll own

- **Pilots:** book and run **1-week trials** with classes/clubs; handle kickoff, reminders, quick wrap-ups.
    
- **Targeted outreach:** personalized DMs/emails (from approved macros), **no spray-and-pray**.
    
- **Social ops:** schedule posts using **approved assets**; reply to comments/DMs with **canned responses**; set UTMs.
    
- **Scoreboard hygiene:** keep a simple sheet updated: Reach → Clicks → Signups → **WFAU** → Day-7 return.
    

## Week-1 (paid) trial

- Build a lightweight CRM (Notion/Sheet): **100 qualified targets** (UMich + 1 other campus).
    
- Send **30 personalized intros** using approved scripts; schedule **3 posts** from our template set.
    
- Book **2 pilots** (can be in flight by week’s end).
    

## Weekly rhythm (after Week-1)

- **Mon:** propose 2 bets; pick 1.
    
- **Tue–Thu:** run the bet + keep pilots/DMs/posts humming.
    
- **Fri:** update scoreboard; 10-min share-back.
    

## Metrics you’ll track

- Replies per 50 targeted messages (aim **≥25%**).
    
- Pilots booked (aim **≥1/week**).
    
- **WFAU** from outreach-sourced cohorts.
    
- Day-7 return % (trend).
    

## Guardrails

- Use only approved claims and assets.
    
- New public copy → quick same-day review by Riley.
    
- No scraping; opt-outs respected.
    

**Bonus:** +$100 per pilot **beyond 2/month** that yields **≥15 WFAU**.

# JD #2 — Student **Lifecycle & Partnerships Lead** (Lauren)

**Type:** 1099 contractor  
**Comp:** **$20/hr** · **10–15 hrs/wk** · initial **4-week pilot**, then monthly renewal  
**Reports to:** Riley (CEO/Product)  
**Location:** Remote or Ann Arbor

## Mission

Convert “heard about it” into **first actions** and add credibility (quotes/caselets) that open doors for more pilots.

## What you’ll own

- **Lifecycle basics:** short **Welcome** + **First-Value nudge** (student tone, 75–120 words) that point to **email a syllabus / import ICS**.
    
- **FAQ macros:** clear replies for privacy/FERPA, setup, “how do I start?”
    
- **Professor/org intros:** concise pilot invitations (1-week trials with two check-ins).
    
- **Caselets:** 1-page “day-in-the-life” snapshots + quotes we can reuse.
    

## Week-1 (paid) trial

- Draft: **Welcome** + **First-Value** emails (in Riley’s voice), **5 FAQ macros**.
    
- Send **2 professor/org intros**; outline **1 caselet** based on a real user.
    

## Weekly rhythm (after Week-1)

- **Mon:** ship/update one lifecycle element; propose 2 bets; pick 1.
    
- **Tue–Thu:** 5 targeted professor/org intros; conduct 1 short interview toward a caselet.
    
- **Fri:** share lifecycle metrics + proposed tweak.
    

## Metrics you’ll track

- % of signups that complete **first action** in 48h (aim **≥25%**).
    
- Open/click rates (iterate weekly).
    
- Co-signs/quotes per month (aim **≥2**).
    
- **WFAU lift** after lifecycle goes live.
    

## Guardrails

- Short, concrete, one job per message.
    
- New public copy → quick same-day review by Riley.
    
- Truthful claims only; no campus/LMS promises beyond **ICS + syllabus@**.
    

**Bonus:** +$100 for each professor/org **co-sign** or **caselet** that lifts click→first-action by **≥10%** week-over-week.

## Shared “Autonomy Charter” (both roles)

**Purpose:** Make more students actually **use** DormWay **this week**.  
**North Star:** **WFAU** (syllabus forwarded / ICS imported within 7 days).

**Freedom lanes**

- **No-review:** reuse approved assets/copy; personalize DMs; pilot check-ins; canned replies.
    
- **Quick-review:** any new public copy/claim or outbound to a list (same-day thumbs-up from Riley).
    
- **Pitch:** anything needing dev time/budget/campus permission — 5-bullet mini-pitch (Idea, Who, Why now, Cost/time ≤1 day, Success = WFAU or pilot). If ✅, ship within 48h.
    

**Cadence:**

- Mon choose bets → Tue–Thu execute → Fri numbers + what to kill.
    
- Track **Reach → Clicks → Signups → WFAU → Day-7 return** by source (pilots / DMs / posts / prof emails). One sheet, no slides.

## Send-along blurb (to Alex & Lauren)

> We’re bringing you both on as a lean **Growth Duo** focused on one outcome: **Weekly First-Action Users** (students who forward a syllabus or import an ICS within 7 days). You’ll have **freedom with a few rails**: truthful claims only, approved assets/voice, and a quick thumbs-up from me for any new public copy. It’s **$20/hr, 10–15 hrs/week**, a **4-week paid pilot**, then we renew monthly off the scoreboard. If a bet moves first-actions, it lives; if not, we kill it and try the next idea—no drama, no heavy meetings.

# **Recruiting Campus Ambassadors at Top 50 College Markets**

  

To efficiently recruit one **DormWay** campus ambassador at each of the top 50 college markets listed, the strategy is to leverage **official campus job boards** and **student online communities**. Nearly all these universities have an online career portal (commonly **Handshake** or a similar system) where employers can post part-time jobs visible to students . In addition, each campus typically has active student forums – for example, dedicated **subreddits** (or local Facebook groups) – which serve as honest, unfiltered hubs of student communication . By posting a call-to-action in these forums, you can reach engaged students directly. Below are the recommended channels for each target campus:

1. **University of Mississippi (Oxford, MS)** – Post the ambassador position on Ole Miss’s official job board (via **Handshake**) . Also share a recruitment message on the **r/olemiss** subreddit (Ole Miss’s student community on Reddit) to catch the attention of students in Oxford.
    
2. **Penn State University Park (State College, PA)** – Use Penn State’s **Nittany Lion Careers** portal (the university’s career management system) to list the job opening . In parallel, post a call-to-action on **r/PennStateUniversity** – a large Reddit community for Penn State students and locals – to reach candidates informally.
    
3. **Clemson University (Clemson, SC)** – Advertise on **ClemsonJobLink** (Clemson’s Symplicity-powered career portal for part-time and internship postings) . Additionally, utilize the **r/Clemson** subreddit (the Clemson family’s home on Reddit) to spread the word among students in this tight-knit college town.
    
4. **Ohio University (Athens, OH)** – Post the opportunity on **Handshake**, which Ohio University uses as its online job posting system for students . Athens is a classic college town, so also consider the **r/OhioUniversity** subreddit or local student Facebook groups to reach Bobcats who might be interested.
    
5. **University of Maine (Orono, ME)** – List the job on UMaine’s career portal (Handshake is promoted as the #1 job board for students at UMaine ). Orono’s community is very campus-centric, so a Reddit post on **r/umaine** (if available) or a notice via the university’s student employment office social media can be effective.
    
6. **Miami University (Oxford, OH)** – Use Miami University’s official job board (likely through Handshake or their career services site) to post the part-time ambassador job. Miami U’s student body is active on social media, so also share the ad on the **r/MiamiUniversity** subreddit (often used by Miami-OH students) or in relevant student group chats/forums.
    
7. **Michigan State University (East Lansing, MI)** – Post on **Handshake** via MSU’s Career Services Network (MSU uses Handshake for student jobs/internships) . Then, share a concise CTA on **r/msu** (the MSU subreddit) or other East Lansing student forums. East Lansing is a true college town, so word spreads quickly in online communities.
    
8. **UC Santa Barbara (Santa Barbara, CA)** – Utilize UCSB’s Handshake portal or campus job bulletin to post the position. UCSB students also frequent the **r/UCSB** subreddit and local Facebook groups for Isla Vista. A post in those channels can attract Gauchos interested in a paid side gig on campus.
    
9. **Virginia Tech (Blacksburg, VA)** – Post on **Handshake** (VT’s career services use Handshake as well) for official reach. Then put a call-out on **r/VirginiaTech** (the VT subreddit) and even the Blacksburg local subreddit or Facebook groups, as a huge portion of the town is Virginia Tech students. One well-placed post can net a few interested Hokies.
    
10. **Washington State University (Pullman, WA)** – Use WSU’s career center job portal (Handshake or a similar system) to reach students looking for work. Also, tap into **r/WashingtonStateUniversity** or **r/WSU** on Reddit, as Pullman’s student community is very active online (Pullman being a small college town means many locals are WSU students).
    
11. **West Virginia University (Morgantown, WV)** – Advertise via WVU’s official student job board (likely Handshake). Then share on **r/WVU** – WVU’s subreddit – or in Morgantown student Facebook groups. WVU’s community is tight, so a Reddit post or even a flier in popular campus hangouts (if feasible) could quickly yield a candidate.
    
12. **University of Delaware (Newark, DE)** – Post on UD’s Handshake-powered career site (UD students regularly check there for part-time gigs). Also consider the **r/ud(elaware)** subreddit or UD student Slack/Discord channels. Newark, DE is very student-oriented, and an informal online post can generate interest among Blue Hens.
    
13. **University of Connecticut (Storrs, CT)** – Use UConn’s **JobX/Handshake** portal for student employment to list the ambassador role. Then post on **r/UConn** (the UConn subreddit) which many Storrs students follow. Given Storrs is a rural campus, online channels like the subreddit or UConn student Facebook pages are key for reaching potential ambassadors.
    
14. **Indiana University Bloomington (Bloomington, IN)** – List the job on **Handshake** via IU Bloomington’s career services. In addition, share on **r/IndianaUniversity** or **r/IUB**. Bloomington is a classic college town; even a mention on the IU subreddit or local Reddit (r/bloomington) could connect you with an interested student .
    
15. **Oklahoma State University (Stillwater, OK)** – Post on OSU’s Hire System (OSU may use Handshake or “HireOSU” portal for student jobs). Augment with a post on **r/okstate** (the OSU subreddit) or Stillwater community pages. Since over half of Stillwater’s population is students, an informal Reddit or Facebook post is likely to reach the right Cowboy quickly.
    
16. **Oregon State University (Corvallis, OR)** – Use OSU’s career site (Handshake) to post the position. Then share a blurb on **r/OregonState** (the subreddit for OSU) and perhaps the Corvallis subreddit. Corvallis is very much a student town, so local online boards will predominantly reach OSU students.
    
17. **UC Davis (Davis, CA)** – Post on UC Davis’s Handshake portal for student jobs. Also drop a notice on **r/UCDavis** (active subreddit for Aggies) and in any UC Davis student job Facebook groups. Davis is a smaller college town, meaning a Reddit post can effectively target a large portion of students there.
    
18. **Texas A&M University (College Station, TX)** – Advertise through **HireAggies**, Texas A&M’s official job platform (powered by Symplicity) . Then post on **r/aggies** or **r/TAMU** (the Texas A&M subreddits) to tap into the Aggie network. College Station is heavily student-populated; even a single Reddit thread or a Greek-life group message could find you a motivated Aggie ambassador.
    
19. **University of Michigan – Ann Arbor (Ann Arbor, MI)** – List the job via U. of Michigan’s Handshake portal (often called “Maize Pages” or similar for student employment). Follow up with a post on **r/uofm** or **r/umich** (Michigan’s subreddit) highlighting the paid campus rep opportunity. Ann Arbor has many online student forums (Reddit, Facebook “Free & For Sale”, etc.) where one post can reach plenty of Wolverines.
    
20. **Cal Poly San Luis Obispo (San Luis Obispo, CA)** – Use Cal Poly’s Handshake job board to post the ambassador role. Complement this with outreach on **r/CalPoly** (subreddit for SLO students) and possibly the Cal Poly subreddit’s Discord if available. SLO is a tight community; an online mention in student groups likely gets traction quickly.
    
21. **James Madison University (Harrisonburg, VA)** – Post on JMU’s Handshake (or “JobLink”) system through the Career Center. Also utilize **r/jmu** on Reddit and local social media (JMU Barter Facebook group, etc.) to publicize the position. Harrisonburg is dominated by JMU students, so these informal channels will effectively target Dukes interested in a side job.
    
22. **Auburn University (Auburn, AL)** – Use Auburn’s career portal (Handshake, branded as Tiger Recruiting Link or similar) to post the job. Then share on **r/auburn** (Auburn’s subreddit) and even consider the Auburn University student job board on Facebook. In a college town like Auburn, many students watch these channels for opportunities.
    
23. **Iowa State University (Ames, IA)** – Post on ISU’s “CyHire” platform (Iowa State’s job board) or Handshake if they use it. Spread the word on **r/iastate** (Iowa State subreddit) and Ames community pages. Ames is very student-centric, and an online CTA in the subreddit or even a mention in a departmental listserv (e.g., Marketing Club) could find a Cyclone to join the team.
    
24. **Arizona State University – Tempe (Tempe, AZ)** – Use ASU’s Handshake portal to post the ambassador role (ASU has a huge student body actively using it). Given ASU’s scale, also post on **r/ASU** (the subreddit for ASU students) to reach a broad audience. You might also try niche channels like the “ASU Jobs & Internships” Facebook group if one exists, but the subreddit and Handshake will cover a wide net.
    
25. **Kansas State University (Manhattan, KS)** – List the job via K-State’s career center site (probably through Handshake or “CareerCats”). Then advertise on **r/KState** (Kansas State’s subreddit) and possibly Manhattan, KS community pages. Manhattan is a true college town (the “Little Apple”), so a local online post is likely to reach K-State students quickly.
    
26. **University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (Urbana-Champaign, IL)** – Post on **Handshake @ Illinois**, the UIUC career services platform . Additionally, take advantage of **r/UIUC**, which has 50,000+ members and is a very direct way to reach Illini students . A well-crafted Reddit post in r/UIUC (and/or a share in UIUC Facebook groups like “UIUC Free & For Sale”) will efficiently find interested students on such a large campus.
    
27. **University of Georgia (Athens, GA)** – Use UGA’s Handshake portal (often called “DawgLink” historically, but now Handshake) to post the job. Then share on **r/UGA** (the UGA subreddit) which many Georgia students follow. In Athens – a quintessential college town – also consider flyers or posts via UGA departmental advisors (e.g., the Terry College of Business might circulate a cool ambassador gig to students), but the subreddit and Handshake should suffice.
    
28. **University of Florida (Gainesville, FL)** – Advertise on UF’s **Gator CareerLink** (UF’s career portal, which is now powered by Handshake) so that UF students see the position. Follow up with a post on **r/ufl** (University of Florida subreddit) to reach students informally. Gainesville is swarming with Gators, and a Reddit or relevant Facebook group post (like “UF Class of 2026”) can quickly surface a candidate.
    
29. **UC Berkeley (Berkeley, CA)** – Post on UC Berkeley’s Handshake platform (**Handshake @ Berkeley**). Then target **r/berkeley** on Reddit, which many Cal students and alumni read. In a tech-savvy campus like Berkeley, Reddit is a popular channel for student chatter, so a brief ad there (and on the UC Berkeley “Free & For Sale” Facebook group) will likely get responses.
    
30. **Colorado State University (Fort Collins, CO)** – Use CSU’s Handshake (or the “CareerRam” system) to post the job for students. Also share on **r/CSU** or **r/FortCollins** – CSU’s subreddit and the local community subreddit – to reach students who might not be actively checking the career board. Fort Collins is a mid-sized college city; a combination of official and Reddit channels works well.
    
31. **Purdue University (West Lafayette, IN)** – List the position on Purdue’s **Handshake** platform (the primary job board for Purdue students). Promote it as well on **r/Purdue** (Purdue’s subreddit) where students often discuss campus life and opportunities. West Lafayette is very campus-focused, so a mention on Reddit or even on Purdue-related Discord servers can snag an interested Boilermaker.
    
32. **University of Alabama (Tuscaloosa, AL)** – Post on UA’s career site (Handshake, branded as **Crimson Careers** or similar) to reach job-seeking students . Then share on **r/UniversityofAlabama** (or **r/rolltide**) subreddit. In Tuscaloosa’s student community, news of a paid part-time gig can travel fast via social media – even the campus-wide GroupMe chats or Greek life email lists could be leveraged.
    
33. **Louisiana State University (Baton Rouge, LA)** – Use LSU’s Handshake portal (**Handshake @ LSU**) for the official job posting. Also post on **r/LSU** (the LSU subreddit) to get the word out to students directly. Baton Rouge has multiple universities, but LSU’s online communities (Reddit, Facebook groups like “LSU Students”) will target the Tigers you need.
    
34. **University of Wisconsin–Madison (Madison, WI)** – Advertise on UW–Madison’s Handshake job board (often called **BuckyNet** historically, but now Handshake). Then head to **r/UWMadison** (the active subreddit for Badgers) and share the opportunity. Madison is a big college town; even Reddit or the “UW Madison Student Jobs” Facebook page can be fruitful for finding one enthusiastic student ambassador.
    
35. **Florida State University (Tallahassee, FL)** – Post on **NoleNetwork** (FSU’s career portal for jobs/internships) – FSU moved from Handshake to NoleNetwork for connecting students with employers . Complement this with a post on **r/FSU** (Florida State’s subreddit) where Seminoles gather online. Tallahassee is very student-heavy, and a Reddit post or tweet from a popular FSU student org could quickly surface candidates.
    
36. **University of Tennessee (Knoxville, TN)** – Use UT Knoxville’s Handshake platform (sometimes called **Hire-A-Vol**). Then post on **r/UTK** or **r/UniversityofTennessee** (the UT Knoxville subreddit) to reach students on Reddit. In addition, UTK has active Facebook groups for student jobs and an Instagram page for the career center – sharing through those could further ensure you get a Volunteer’s attention.
    
37. **University of Kentucky (Lexington, KY)** – Post via UK’s Handshake job board (the UK Career Center uses Handshake). Also utilize **r/UniversityofKentucky** (Kentucky’s subreddit) for informal outreach. Lexington’s student population is large; you might also consider reaching out to the UK Student Government or career center to amplify the message, but a Handshake posting plus Reddit should find at least one Wildcat interested.
    
38. **University of Missouri (Columbia, MO)** – Use Mizzou’s career portal (Handshake, branded as **HireMizzouTigers**) to post the job. Follow that with a post on **r/mizzou** (University of Missouri subreddit) to tap into the student buzz. Columbia, MO is dominated by students and a Reddit post or a tweet from a popular student account can be an efficient way to find a Mizzou ambassador.
    
39. **University of South Carolina (Columbia, SC)** – Post on UofSC’s Handshake-based job board (**SC Handshake**). In addition, share on **r/Gamecocks** (the USC subreddit, as South Carolina students often congregate under the Gamecocks moniker on Reddit ). Columbia, SC has a strong student presence; consider also emailing the advertising/PR student club or posting in the UofSC Facebook community for maximum reach.
    
40. **Texas Tech University (Lubbock, TX)** – List the position on Texas Tech’s career site (often **Hire Red Raiders** on Handshake). Then post on **r/TexasTech** (Texas Tech’s subreddit) as well as any relevant local channels (Lubbock has a subreddit and TTU student Facebook groups). Lubbock’s student density means a single well-placed online post can quickly find your Red Raider rep.
    
41. **University of Oregon (Eugene, OR)** – Use UO’s Handshake portal (**DuckConnect** if it’s still called that) to post the job. Then drop a line on **r/UofO** or **r/UniversityofOregon** (the UO subreddit) to reach Ducks directly. Eugene is a classic college town; even posting on the ASUO (student union) Facebook or local job boards like Eugene Craigslist (under part-time jobs for students) could help, but the subreddit + Handshake are likely enough.
    
42. **University of Arkansas (Fayetteville, AR)** – Advertise on **Handshake @ Arkansas** (UA’s job board for students). Follow up with a post on **r/UniversityofArkansas** (UARK subreddit) to engage students in Fayetteville. You could also contact the UA Career Development Center to see if they’ll circulate the opportunity. Since Fayetteville is very student-centric, informal networks and the official board together will reach Razorbacks on campus.
    
43. **University of Maryland (College Park, MD)** – Post on UMD’s career portal (Handshake, branded as **Careers4Terps** in the past). Additionally, use **r/UMD** (University of Maryland subreddit) to get exposure among students. College Park is adjacent to D.C., but the campus has its own strong community – a Reddit post, or even a mention in the UMD subreddit’s weekly threads, can find interested Terps. Also consider posting on the UMD CS or Business school internship boards if accessible.
    
44. **Mississippi State University (Starkville, MS)** – Use MSU’s career center job board (likely Handshake or a system called **Connections**). Then share on **r/MississippiState** (if available) or the Starkville subreddit (since Starkville is largely the MSU community). A lot of Mississippi State students keep an eye on local social media (for example, the **Bulldog Network** on Facebook or similar), so those could be secondary options to find one keen student.
    
45. **Ohio State University (Columbus, OH)** – Post the job on **Handshake @ Ohio State** (OSU’s university-wide job posting system) so it reaches students across all majors. Given OSU’s enormous size, also post on **r/OSU** or **r/OhioState** (Reddit communities for Ohio State) for added visibility. In a big city like Columbus, the **campus-specific channels** are crucial to target students. Even a flyer or digital sign in the Ohio Union could help, but an online push via Handshake and Reddit will likely yield a Buckeye or two interested.
    
46. **University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ)** – Use UArizona’s Handshake portal (often called **Wildcat JobLink** historically) to post the gig. Then promote it on **r/UofA** or **r/UArizona** (the subreddit for University of Arizona students). Tucson has a strong campus culture despite being a city, so the student subreddit and possibly a mention on the ASUA (student govt) social media might quickly find a willing Wildcat ambassador.
    
47. **NC State University (Raleigh, NC)** – Post on NCSU’s career portal (Handshake, via **ePack** system for NC State). Also share on **r/NCSU** (the NC State subreddit) where many students look for advice and opportunities. In Raleigh’s environment, NC State students are best reached through campus-specific channels (like the subreddit or the Engineering school’s listservs). A combination of ePack job listing and a Reddit post should net at least one Wolfpack member for the role.
    
48. **University of Washington (Seattle, WA)** – Use UW’s Handshake-based job board (**HuskyJobs** was the old name, now merged into Handshake) to post the position. Complement this with a post on **r/udub** or **r/UWashington** (the UW Seattle subreddit) to reach students in Seattle. Since Seattle is a large city (and UW’s student body is a smaller fraction of the city), sticking to university-specific outlets (career board, subreddit, maybe the UW Facebook groups) is the most efficient way to find a Husky ambassador.
    
49. **UCLA (Los Angeles, CA)** – Post on UCLA’s Handshake portal (**BruinView** in the past, now Handshake). Then target **r/UCLA** on Reddit – a community of UCLA students and alumni – with a concise ad for the campus rep job. In a vast city like L.A., the UCLA subreddit and UCLA-specific job boards are critical; you could also utilize UCLA’s own student listservs or the Daily Bruin classifieds. Even one well-placed Reddit post in r/UCLA can surface interested Bruins due to the strong online community.
    
50. **Rutgers University (New Brunswick, NJ)** – List the job via **Rutgers Handshake** (Rutgers’ career services platform for New Brunswick campus). Follow that with a post on **r/rutgers** (Rutgers subreddit) highlighting the gig for students. New Brunswick is a classic college town within a metro area, so Rutgers-centric channels are the most efficient. You might also contact Rutgers student organizations (perhaps the Residence Hall Association or Entrepreneurship club) to share the opportunity, but a Handshake posting plus Reddit outreach should yield a candidate or two.
    

  

**Why These Channels:** Campus **job boards** ensure your posting is seen by students actively seeking work, which is ideal for finding a **paid, part-time “street team”** role. For example, universities like Ole Miss explicitly direct students to Handshake for part-time jobs , and schools like Texas A&M run their own Symplicity-powered portals for employers to connect with students . On the other hand, **Reddit communities** and similar student forums provide a direct line to the student body in a less formal way. Many of these subreddits (e.g. r/UIUC with 50k members) are highly active and **offer a direct, authentic way to communicate with students on campus** . As one higher-ed social media expert noted, if a campus doesn’t have its own subreddit, the subreddit of the town or city is often used by students instead – underscoring that there is an online community for virtually every campus.

  

By **prioritizing the university’s official job board and the campus’s student Reddit**, you cover both the formal and informal avenues to reach students. This two-pronged approach should efficiently yield a few interested candidates at each campus with minimal spend. In summary:

- **Official Campus Job Boards** (Handshake or equivalent): Post the ambassador job to reach students looking for campus work . These platforms are trusted and widely used at each university, ensuring your CTA appears in front of eligible students in that market.
    
- **Campus Subreddits & Social Media**: Share a brief, catchy call-to-action on the university’s subreddit (e.g., _“Paid Campus Ambassador Wanted – 5hrs/week promoting a new dorm service (DormWay). Great resume booster + $$ – DM me for details!”_). The subreddit community consists of students, and such posts can get quick traction if the opportunity sounds appealing. For example, the **Penn State** and **UCLA** subreddits explicitly serve students, faculty, and alumni in those communities  . Engaging these channels taps into the word-of-mouth of campus life.
    
- **Additional Avenues (if needed)**: Depending on the campus, also consider **Facebook groups** (many schools have “Jobs & Internships” or class year groups), student **email newsletters**, or departmental bulletin boards. In smaller college towns (Tier 1 and 2 on your list), even a flyer at a popular coffee shop or a post on the town’s community page can be surprisingly effective due to the high percentage of students in the local population. However, the primary focus should remain on the online student hubs mentioned above for efficiency.
    

  

Using these methods for each of the 50 campuses will maximize your reach to potential DormWay ambassadors with minimal waste. By hitting the official job boards _and_ the student-driven forums, you ensure that **at least one motivated student on each campus** sees your advertisement and can respond. Good luck with building your DormWay campus ambassador team!

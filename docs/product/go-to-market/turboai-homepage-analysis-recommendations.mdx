**Estimated Effort**: 6 hours
**Code Location**:
- `page.tsx:149-162` (workflowSteps)
- `page.tsx:186-191` (inline file/email state)

---

### 6. Unique Positioning ⭐⭐

#### Turbo.ai Positioning
- **"Active assistant" not "passive tool"**: Emphasizes collaboration
- **Live collaboration feature**: Unconventional in note-taking space
- **Desktop app anticipation**: Maintains momentum and future vision

#### DormWay Differentiators to Emphasize
- ✅ **Context-aware intelligence**: Turbo is general-purpose; DormWay is campus-specific (location, events, weather)

---

### 7. Mobile-First Considerations ⚠️

#### Turbo.ai Approach
- Responsive grid systems (`grid-cols-1 lg:grid-cols-2`)
- Fluid typography with `clamp()`
- Touch-friendly button sizes (`h-10 sm:h-12`)
- FAQ section supports mobile scrolling

#### DormWay Check
- Has responsive breakpoints in code
- Uses Tailwind responsive utilities

#### Recommendations
- ✅ **Verify touch targets**: Buttons should be minimum 44x44px on mobile
- ✅ **Mobile CTA placement**: Ensure primary CTA is thumb-reachable
- ✅ **Drag-drop alternative on mobile**: Show QR code to email `syllabus@dormway.app` instead
- ✅ **Test globe performance**: CampusGlobe might be heavy on mobile - consider fallback
- ⚠️ **Mobile-first testing**: Test on actual devices, not just responsive mode

**Implementation Priority**: 🟡 MEDIUM
**Estimated Effort**: 4 hours (testing + fixes)
**Code Location**: Throughout responsive utilities

## Voice & Tone Considerations

### Riley's Labs Page Voice Analysis

The **DormWay Labs Alpha Cohort page** demonstrates a highly effective voice that could inform homepage copy. Key characteristics:

#### Authenticity & Transparency
- **First-person narrative**: "I'm Riley. I'm 22, at U-M..."
- **Honest about origins**: "I didn't know how to code when I started — I learned by using Claude Code"
- **Real stakes**: "We need help breaking it before they do" / "Help us not embarrass ourselves in January"
- **No corporate speak**: Direct, conversational, student-to-student
- **⚠️ IMPORTANT CLARIFICATION**: While Riley learned to code using Claude Code, DormWay is NOT just "AI-coded." It's a sophisticated production system with complex architecture:
  - Temporal workflow orchestration (durable execution engine)
  - PostGIS spatial database for campus detection
  - Real-time messaging via Ably
  - Canvas LMS integration
  - Multiple AI systems (not just LLMs): context-aware intelligence, workflow DAGs, student digital twins
  - The messaging should emphasize: "Built using AI tools" ≠ "Just AI-generated code"

#### Specificity Over Vagueness
- **Concrete numbers**: "10 weeks", "20 students", "5-8 hours/week", "300+ bugs", "50+ syllabus formats"
- **Real examples**: "went from C+ to A-" (borrowed from Turbo but specific)
- **Actual constraints**: "You need an iPhone with iOS 17+" (doesn't hide limitations)
- **Timeline transparency**: "Nov 18 start date", "Applications close when we hit 20 people"

#### Value Exchange Framework
- **Two-column "What you get / What we need"** format makes the ask clear
- **Practical benefits**: LinkedIn rec, portfolio proof, first look at hiring
- **Real work expectations**: "10+ bugs/week", "Weekly calls", "File detailed bugs"
- **No fluff**: Every bullet point is actionable and specific

#### Technical Credibility Without Gatekeeping
- **Shows the stack**: "Claude Code, Temporal, the whole thing"
- **Explains process**: "See how we go from 'this is broken' to 'shipped and fixed' in days"
- **Lowers barrier**: "doesn't matter what" you've built, just that you've built something
- **Admits constraints**: Need iPhone, need time commitment (no false accessibility)
- **Technical depth**: Labs page mentions real tech (Temporal, Claude Code) - not dumbed down
- **⚠️ CRITICAL**: Homepage should emphasize DormWay's AI sophistication:
  - Multiple AI systems in production (not just one LLM)
  - Workflow orchestration for complex student context
  - Real-time intelligence processing
  - Spatial AI for campus detection
  - Student "digital twin" concept (Temporal workflows tracking each student)

### Applying This Voice to Homepage

#### Current Homepage Weaknesses (Compared to Labs Voice)
- **Too polished**: May feel corporate compared to Labs' authenticity
- **Vague value props**: Rotating text lacks specificity of "Under 60s from syllabus to plan"
- **Hidden constraints**: Labs explicitly says "need iPhone", homepage doesn't clarify what students need
- **Missing personality**: Labs has Riley's voice; homepage is brand-voice

#### Recommended Voice Shifts for Homepage

**1. Add Founder Voice Section**
Consider a "Built by Students, For Students" section:
```
"I'm Riley. I built DormWay because I kept missing deadlines buried in syllabi.
I learned to code while building this using AI tools. But DormWay isn't just AI-generated—
it's a production system with Temporal workflows, spatial databases, real-time messaging,
and multiple AI systems working together. Now we're helping students at 6,134 schools
turn their syllabi into action plans in under 60 seconds."
```

**Messaging Framework**:
- ✅ "Built using AI development tools like Claude Code"
- ✅ "AI-powered features: context-aware intelligence, automated planning, smart notifications"
- ❌ "AI-coded app" (implies it's just generated code without architecture)
- ✅ "Complex production system that uses AI in multiple ways"

**2. Be Specific About What You Need**
Labs says "You need: iPhone with iOS 17+" — Homepage could say:
```
"Works on: iOS 17+ (iPhone), Web (any browser), Canvas LMS"
"What you need: Your syllabus (PDF/email/Canvas), 60 seconds, that's it"
```

**3. Show Real Numbers in Context**
Labs: "300+ bugs filed total" — Homepage could show:
```
"We've processed 15,000+ syllabi across 6,134 schools"
"Average plan generation: 58 seconds"
"Students save 4+ hours per week on planning"
```

**4. Transparent Value Exchange**
Labs uses two-column exchange format — Homepage could adapt:
```
What you get:
- Plans that update as your semester changes
- Automated deadline tracking across all courses
- Context-aware reminders when you need them

What you give us:
- Your syllabus (we'll parse it in under 60s)
- Permission to send you smart notifications
- Feedback to make DormWay better
```

**5. Lower Barriers with Honesty**
Labs: "doesn't matter what you've built, just that you've built something"
Homepage: "No account needed to try it. Just email your syllabus to syllabus@dormway.app"

#### Copywriting Principles from Labs Page

| Principle | Labs Example | Homepage Application |
|-----------|--------------|---------------------|
| **Admit limitations** | "You need an iPhone" | "Currently iOS + Web (Android coming Spring '25)" |
| **Quantify everything** | "300+ bugs", "50+ formats" | "6,134 schools", "Under 60s", "15,000+ syllabi" |
| **Show real process** | "See us debug stuff" | "Watch your plan build in real-time" |
| **Personal narrative** | "I'm Riley. I'm 22..." | "Built by Riley (22, U-M) who kept missing deadlines" |
| **Transparent ask** | "Help us not embarrass ourselves" | "Help us improve by reporting bugs you find" |
| **Concrete timeline** | "Nov 18 - Jan 27" | "January 2025 launch • 6,134 schools supported today" |

### Tone Spectrum Recommendation

**Labs Page**: 9/10 casual, 1/10 formal (appropriate for cohort recruitment)
**Homepage**: 6/10 casual, 4/10 formal (broader audience, includes skeptics)

**Maintain from Labs**:
- First-person narrative (Riley's story)
- Specific numbers and timelines
- Honest about constraints
- Value exchange clarity
- Technical credibility without jargon

**Adjust for Homepage**:
- Less "help us" framing, more "built for you"
- Professional enough for faculty/parents who might check it
- Emphasize proven results over beta testing
- Show social proof beyond just student testimonials

### Example Homepage Hero with Labs Voice

**Before** (Current):
> [Rotating text with multiple value props]

**After** (Labs-inspired with AI Architecture emphasis):
> **From syllabus to plan in under 60 seconds**
>
> I'm Riley. I built DormWay because I kept missing stuff buried in syllabi.
> I learned to code using AI tools—but DormWay is a sophisticated production system
> with Temporal workflows, spatial intelligence, and real-time AI working together.
>
> Tested by students at 6,134 schools. Turn your syllabi into automated action plans.
>
> [Free Forever • No Account Needed to Try • iOS + Web]

**Alternative Hero (Emphasizing AI Sophistication)**:
> **AI-powered planning that actually understands your semester**
>
> Not just another LLM wrapper. DormWay uses multiple AI systems in production:
> workflow orchestration, spatial intelligence, real-time context processing,
> and your personal "digital twin" that adapts as your semester changes.
>
> Built by a student who had the problem. Used by 6,134 schools.
>
> [See How It Works • Free Forever]

**Call to Action Options**:
- Primary: "Email Your Syllabus" (to syllabus@dormway.app)
- Secondary: "See the Architecture" (show tech stack diagram - appeals to technical audience)
- Tertiary: "Join 15,000+ Students" (waitlist for unavailable schools)

# DormWay FAQ

## General

### What is DormWay?
DormWay is an AI-powered platform designed to be the essential companion app for college students nationwide. We like to think of it as the "iOS for college students" - a comprehensive platform that handles everything from academic scheduling to campus navigation, all powered by intelligent automation.

At its core, DormWay solves a fundamental problem: college students juggle dozens of different apps, websites, and systems just to manage their daily academic life. From checking multiple syllabi to remember due dates, to navigating between different LMS platforms for each class, to finding campus resources - it's overwhelming and inefficient. DormWay consolidates all of this into one intelligent platform that actually understands your academic context and adapts to your needs.

What makes us different is our AI-native approach. Every feature is built with intelligence at its core, meaning the app learns from collective student behavior to provide better recommendations, smarter scheduling, and more relevant information for everyone on the platform.

### Who can use DormWay?
DormWay is available to all college students across the United States. We're building for 20 million students nationwide, not just individual campuses. This nationwide approach is intentional - we believe the best insights come from understanding student behavior across all universities, not just within isolated campus bubbles.

Whether you're at a large state university, a small liberal arts college, or a community college, DormWay adapts to your specific campus environment while leveraging insights from the entire network. The platform becomes more valuable as students from different schools join, creating a true network effect where everyone benefits from collective intelligence.

Graduate students, undergraduates, part-time students, and full-time students all find value in DormWay. The platform adapts to different academic schedules and requirements, making it useful regardless of your specific program or course load.

### Is DormWay free?
Yes, DormWay is 100% free for students. Forever. No premium tiers, no paywalls, no hidden costs. Every feature we build is available to every student who uses the platform. This isn't a marketing gimmick or a limited-time offer - it's fundamental to our mission and business model.

We believe that tools for academic success should be universally accessible. College is expensive enough without having to pay for apps just to manage your coursework. That's why we've structured our business model around strategic partnerships rather than student subscriptions. We will never charge students to use DormWay.

This means you get everything: full AI capabilities, unlimited syllabus processing, complete scheduling features, all study tools, and every future feature we develop. There's no "premium" version because we don't believe in creating artificial barriers to student success. When we add new features, everyone gets them immediately.

Our commitment to free access isn't just idealistic - it's strategic. By removing all financial barriers, we can reach all 20 million college students in America, creating the network effects that make the platform valuable for everyone. The more students who use DormWay, the smarter it becomes for all users.

### When is DormWay available?
DormWay is available right now through DormWay Locked, our web interface that works on any device with a browser. You can start using it immediately - no waiting list, no beta access needed. Just visit our website, sign up, and you're in.

"Locked" stands for "Locked In" - it's DormWay designed for those situations that demand complete focus. Whether you're planning your semester, organizing assignments, or need to get your academic life together, Locked provides the focused interface to make it happen. It's not a limited version - it's DormWay optimized for deep work and serious academic planning.

The iOS app is coming soon and will complement the Locked experience with mobile-specific features like widgets, notifications, and deeper iOS integration. But you don't need to wait - Locked gives you full DormWay functionality today, accessible from any device.

Android development will follow after we perfect the iOS experience. In the meantime, Locked works perfectly on Android browsers, ensuring no student is left behind regardless of their device choice.

## Features

### How does syllabus processing work?
Our syllabus processing is genuinely magical - and we mean that in the most technical sense. Simply forward any syllabus to syllabus@dormway.app, and within seconds, our AI extracts every assignment, exam, project deadline, reading schedule, and important date, then automatically syncs them to your calendar with intelligent reminders.

Here's what happens behind the scenes: Our AI doesn't just do simple text extraction. It understands academic context, recognizes different syllabus formats, interprets relative dates ("Week 3 Tuesday" becomes an actual calendar date), and even identifies implied deadlines. If your professor mentions that "drafts should be submitted a week before the final paper," our AI catches that and creates both deadlines.

The system handles any format - PDF, Word documents, even poorly scanned images. It works with every teaching style, from highly structured syllabi to more casual course outlines. The AI also recognizes updates; if you forward a revised syllabus mid-semester, it intelligently updates only what's changed without duplicating existing entries.

Best of all, this feature learns from collective usage. The more syllabi we process across all universities, the better our AI becomes at understanding different academic conventions, making it more accurate for everyone.

### What is DormWay Locked?
DormWay Locked - "Locked In" - is our web-based interface designed for those situations that demand complete focus. It's not a limited version or a beta - it's DormWay optimized for serious academic work, available right now through any web browser.

Locked represents our philosophy that managing your academic life shouldn't be a distraction - it should help you lock in and focus on what matters. The interface is clean, fast, and purposeful. No distractions, no unnecessary features, just the tools you need to organize your academic life and get to work.

We chose to launch with Locked for several strategic reasons. It allows us to iterate rapidly based on real user feedback, ensures every student can access DormWay immediately regardless of their device, and lets us perfect our AI features at scale. Locked works on any device with a browser - laptop, tablet, phone - adapting seamlessly to your screen size.

The name "Locked" also reflects our commitment: we're locked in on making the best possible platform for students. Every feature in Locked is battle-tested and refined based on real student needs. When you use Locked, you're getting a focused, powerful tool that helps you lock in on academic success.

### Can DormWay integrate with my university's LMS?
Currently, DormWay doesn't directly integrate with Learning Management Systems like Canvas, Blackboard, or Moodle - but we've built smart workarounds that are often even easier to use. We can ingest ICS calendar files, process any documents or notes you share with us, and our AI can understand and organize information from any source.

Here's how it works now: Export your calendar from your LMS as an ICS file and import it into DormWay. Copy and paste assignment lists, syllabi, or course schedules. Forward any course-related emails to us. Our AI is sophisticated enough to understand and organize this information automatically, often doing a better job than direct integrations because we can apply intelligence that rigid API connections can't.

We are actively working on direct LMS integration. When it launches, it will be seamless - authenticate once and DormWay will automatically stay synchronized with all your courses. But even without direct integration, students tell us our current approach is surprisingly powerful. The AI makes sense of whatever you throw at it, turning chaos into organization.

The advantage of our AI-native approach is flexibility. While other apps break when a professor uses their LMS differently than expected, DormWay adapts. Whether your professor posts everything in the syllabus, drops surprise assignments in the announcements, or sends updates via email, DormWay can handle it all.

### What makes DormWay different from other campus apps?
The fundamental difference is that DormWay is a platform, not just an app. While other campus apps focus on single universities or specific functions, we're building the comprehensive operating system for college life nationwide. And crucially, we're not affiliated with any university - we're independent, which means we work for students, not institutions.

Our network intelligence approach means that insights from students at MIT can help improve the experience for students at community colleges in California. When thousands of students across the country are struggling with similar organic chemistry concepts, our AI identifies these patterns and can proactively provide resources and study recommendations. This isn't possible with isolated campus apps.

We're AI-native, not AI-added. Every feature is designed with intelligence at its core, not bolted on as an afterthought. DormWay takes into account everything that matters for a student when sorting through information: weather (will it rain during your walk to class?), traffic (is there a game causing campus gridlock?), even travel plans (when should you start that assignment if you're flying home for break?). This contextual intelligence is unprecedented in education technology.

Finally, DormWay grows with you. It learns your patterns, adapts to your preferences, and becomes more valuable over time. The platform you use as a freshman evolves to meet your needs as a senior, and the collective intelligence means it's always improving for everyone. All of this, completely free, forever.

## Privacy & Security

### Is my data secure?
Security isn't just a feature at DormWay - it's foundational to everything we build. We implement multiple layers of protection to ensure your academic and personal information remains private and secure.

All data transmission uses industry-standard TLS encryption, the same technology banks use for online transactions. Your data at rest is encrypted using AES-256, making it unreadable even if someone somehow accessed our servers. We use secure cloud infrastructure from major providers with SOC 2 compliance and regular security audits.

But technical security is just the start. We've designed our entire system with privacy-first principles. We process data on-device whenever possible, meaning sensitive information like your study patterns might never leave your phone. When we do need cloud processing for AI features, we use techniques like differential privacy and data minimization to protect your identity.

Our security team continuously monitors for threats, and we maintain a bug bounty program that rewards security researchers who help us identify potential vulnerabilities. We also conduct regular third-party security audits and penetration testing to ensure our defenses remain robust against evolving threats.

FERPA compliance is built into every feature, ensuring we meet or exceed federal requirements for protecting educational records. We're transparent about our security practices and happy to provide detailed documentation to university IT departments who want to verify our security posture.

### How does DormWay handle my academic information?
We treat your academic information with the utmost respect and protection it deserves. Under FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act), your educational records require special handling, and we've built our entire infrastructure around these requirements.

When you share academic information with DormWay - whether it's syllabi, grades, schedules, or assignments - that data is immediately encrypted and associated only with your account. We never share individual academic records with third parties, including your university, other students, or advertisers. Your professors cannot see what you do in DormWay, and your parents can't access your account unless you explicitly grant them permission.

We use your academic data solely to provide and improve DormWay's services for you. This means using AI to parse your syllabi, analyze your study patterns, provide scheduling recommendations, and answer questions about your courses. When we use collective data to improve our AI models, it's always anonymized and aggregated - we look at patterns across thousands of students, never individual behaviors.

You maintain complete control over your data. You can export everything at any time, delete specific items, or close your account entirely with true deletion of all associated data. We don't play games with "soft deletes" or data retention after you leave - when you say delete, we mean delete.

Importantly, we're transparent about data handling. Our privacy policy is written in plain English, not legal jargon, and we notify you clearly whenever we update our practices.

### What data does DormWay collect?
We collect only what's necessary to provide valuable services, and we're transparent about every type of data we handle. Here's a comprehensive breakdown:

**Academic Data**: This includes syllabi you upload, schedules from LMS integrations, assignment due dates, and course materials. We use this to power core features like automatic scheduling and deadline reminders. This data is always encrypted and never shared with third parties.

**Usage Analytics**: We track how you interact with DormWay to improve the product - which features you use most, where you might get stuck, and what causes errors. This is anonymous behavioral data, not personal information. We use privacy-preserving analytics that don't track you across the web.

**Location Data**: Only when you explicitly permit it, and only for features that require it like campus navigation or finding nearby study spots. You can turn this off anytime, and we don't track location history - we only use real-time location when you're actively using location-based features.

**Communication Data**: If you use DormWay to coordinate with study groups or communicate with classmates, we store these messages securely to enable the feature. These are end-to-end encrypted where technically feasible.

**Device Information**: Basic technical data like your device type and OS version to ensure compatibility and optimal performance. We don't access your contacts, photos, or other apps unless you explicitly grant permission for a specific feature.

We explicitly DO NOT collect: Financial information (except for premium subscriptions through standard payment processors), health records, social media passwords, or any data from other apps on your device without explicit permission.

### Can my university see my DormWay activity?
No, absolutely not. DormWay is completely independent - we're not affiliated with any university, and we maintain a strict firewall between student data and institutional access.

Your university cannot see how you use DormWay, what notes you take, when you study, or any other activity within the platform. Even if your university wanted to partner with DormWay for anonymous analytics in the future, any data sharing would be completely opt-in on your part, and would only provide aggregated, de-identified trend data - never individual activity.

This independence is crucial for student trust and fundamental to our mission. You should feel free to use DormWay to manage your real academic life, including struggles with courses, time management challenges, or anything else, without worrying that your university is watching. We built DormWay for students, not for universities.

Any sharing of academic data is opt-in. You control what information, if any, is shared and with whom. The default is complete privacy - nothing is shared unless you explicitly choose to share it. We've had universities ask for student data, and we've always said no. This isn't negotiable for us. DormWay exists to serve students, not to be a surveillance tool for institutions.

## Technical

### What platforms does DormWay support?
DormWay is designed to be accessible everywhere you need it, with a strategic rollout plan that prioritizes quality and user experience.

**Web (DormWay Lock)** - Available now through any modern browser. This includes Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge on both desktop and mobile devices. The web app is fully responsive, meaning it adapts perfectly whether you're using it on a laptop in the library or on your phone walking to class. No installation required - just visit our website and log in.

**iOS** - Our primary mobile development focus. We're building a native SwiftUI application that takes full advantage of iOS capabilities including widgets, Siri integration, Focus mode integration, and Apple's on-device AI processing. The iOS app will provide the richest experience with features like offline mode, push notifications, and seamless calendar integration with your iPhone.

**Android** - Planned for development after iOS launch. We know a huge portion of college students use Android, and we're committed to providing feature parity. The Android app will leverage Material Design principles and integrate with Google services while maintaining the same powerful AI capabilities.

**API Access** - For power users and developers, we're planning to offer API access that lets you integrate DormWay data with your own workflows. Imagine automatically importing your schedule into Notion, or building custom study tools that leverage our AI parsing capabilities.

The beauty of our approach is that all platforms sync seamlessly. Start something on your laptop, continue on your phone, finish on a library computer - your data is always current across all devices.

### How does the AI work?
DormWay's AI isn't just a chatbot bolted onto a calendar app - it's a sophisticated system of multiple AI models working together to understand and support your academic life.

At the foundation, we use large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on academic content to understand educational contexts. When you upload a syllabus, the AI doesn't just extract text - it understands academic conventions, recognizes different assignment types, interprets grading rubrics, and can even identify prerequisites and learning objectives that aren't explicitly stated.

Our scheduling AI uses reinforcement learning trained on anonymized student success patterns. It learns what makes students successful - not just in terms of grades, but in maintaining healthy balance. It can recognize when you're overloaded before you realize it yourself and suggest adjustments that have helped similar students.

The recommendation engine uses collaborative filtering enhanced with deep learning. When we suggest study resources or campus events, we're not just matching keywords. The AI understands complex relationships - if you're struggling with organic chemistry and have a visual learning style, it might recommend specific YouTube channels that have helped similar learners, or study groups that match your schedule and learning pace.

We also use specialized models for specific tasks: computer vision for processing handwritten notes or photographed whiteboards, natural language processing for answering questions about your specific courses, and predictive models for anticipating your needs (like reminding you to start that paper earlier because it's worth 30% of your grade).

Importantly, we use federated learning techniques where possible, meaning the AI can learn from collective patterns without centralizing sensitive data. Your personal academic information can contribute to improving the AI while remaining private and secure on your device.

### Do I need to install anything?
For DormWay Lock (our current web app), you don't need to install anything at all. Simply visit our website from any device with a web browser, create an account or log in, and you're ready to go. The web app works instantly without downloads, plugins, or extensions.

The beauty of our web-first approach is zero friction. You can be up and running in under 60 seconds. No storage space required on your device, no compatibility issues, no waiting for downloads. You can even use DormWay on shared computers in the library or computer lab - just log in through the browser and log out when you're done.

When our mobile apps launch, installation will be just as simple. One tap from the App Store or Google Play, using your existing account credentials. The mobile apps will offer additional benefits like offline access and push notifications, but they're optional enhancements - the web version provides full core functionality.

We've also designed the web app to be "installable" as a Progressive Web App (PWA) on devices that support it. This means you can add DormWay to your home screen and use it like a native app, with its own icon and full-screen experience, while still technically running in your browser.

For university IT departments concerned about security, our web-based approach means no software deployment challenges, no version control issues, and no compatibility problems. Students can start using DormWay immediately without needing IT support or administrative privileges.

### Can I use DormWay offline?
Offline functionality is carefully designed to ensure you have access to critical information even without an internet connection, while being transparent about which features require connectivity.

**What works offline (once synced):**
- Viewing your complete schedule and calendar
- Accessing previously downloaded syllabi and course materials  
- Reviewing saved notes and study materials
- Checking assignment due dates and exam schedules
- Basic navigation of familiar campus routes

**What requires internet connection:**
- AI processing for new syllabi or questions
- Real-time collaboration features with study groups
- LMS synchronization and updates
- Location-based services for finding study spots
- Uploading new materials or assignments
- Advanced AI recommendations and insights

When you go offline, DormWay intelligently caches the most important information based on your usage patterns. If you regularly check your Thursday schedule on Wednesday night, that data is prioritized for offline access. The app learns your patterns and pre-loads what you're likely to need.

The mobile apps (when launched) will have expanded offline capabilities compared to the web version, including the ability to queue actions while offline that automatically sync when you reconnect. For example, you could add a study session note while offline in the library basement, and it would sync as soon as you're back online.

We're also working on enabling certain AI features offline using on-device processing for iOS, though these will initially be limited to simpler tasks like basic schedule analysis rather than complex syllabus parsing.

## Growth & Community

### How does DormWay grow?
DormWay's growth model is fundamentally different from traditional campus apps that require university-by-university sales processes. We grow through network effects - a powerful dynamic where each new user makes the platform exponentially more valuable for everyone else.

Think about it this way: When you join DormWay and upload your syllabus, our AI learns something new about how professors structure courses. When your study group coordinates through DormWay, we learn about effective collaboration patterns. When thousands of students across the country are taking similar courses, we can identify the most challenging concepts and proactively provide resources. This collective intelligence is impossible to achieve with isolated campus apps.

Our viral coefficient target is above 1.3, meaning each user brings in more than one additional user on average. This happens naturally because DormWay works better when your friends use it too. Study group coordination, shared note-taking, and social features all create natural invitation moments. We don't spam or use aggressive growth tactics - the product's value drives organic sharing.

We also leverage strategic timing. The beginning of each semester creates natural adoption waves as students share tools that help them get organized. Our syllabus forwarding feature is inherently viral - when one student shows a friend how they instantly organized their entire semester with one email forward, that friend immediately wants to do the same.

The platform strategy means we don't need to negotiate with individual universities or wait for bureaucratic approval processes. Students can start using DormWay immediately, and as adoption grows at each campus, we add more campus-specific features, creating a flywheel effect that accelerates growth.

### Can I invite friends?
Absolutely! In fact, DormWay is specifically designed to become more valuable when you use it with friends. This isn't just about growth for us - it's about creating a better experience for you.

When your study group is on DormWay, you can coordinate sessions, share notes, and track group project deadlines seamlessly. When your roommates use it, you can coordinate schedules and share campus information. When classmates in your major use it, you benefit from shared insights about professors, courses, and resources.

We make sharing effortless but never spammy. You can invite friends through a simple link, by sharing your successful syllabus import, or by showing them features in person. We don't access your contacts without permission or send messages on your behalf. Every invitation is intentional and comes from genuine value you've experienced.

We also reward both you and your friends for successful invitations. This might include premium feature trials, priority access to new features, or other benefits that enhance your DormWay experience. The exact rewards vary, but the principle remains constant: when you help DormWay grow, we give back to our community.

Most importantly, when more students at your campus join DormWay, we can add hyperlocal features specific to your university. Building occupancy data, dining recommendations, and campus event integration all become possible when we reach critical mass at your school.

### How many students use DormWay?
We're in the rapid growth phase, scaling toward our goal of becoming the essential platform for all 20 million college students in the United States. While we don't disclose exact user numbers publicly (this is strategic for competitive reasons), we can share that we're seeing exponential growth patterns that validate our network effects model.

What's more important than raw numbers is engagement and value creation. Students who join DormWay don't just sign up and forget about it - they actively use the platform throughout their academic journey. Our daily active usage rates are multiples higher than typical education apps because DormWay becomes part of students' essential workflow, not just another app they occasionally check.

We measure success not just in total users but in network density at specific campuses. When we reach 15-20% penetration at a campus, we see a tipping point where growth becomes self-sustaining through word-of-mouth. We're hitting these tipping points at more campuses each month.

The collective intelligence of our platform grows with every user. We've already processed millions of pages of syllabi, analyzed thousands of course patterns, and learned from countless study sessions. This data, properly anonymized and aggregated, makes DormWay smarter for everyone. Every new user doesn't just add one to our user count - they add to the collective intelligence that benefits all students on the platform.

## Business Model

### How does DormWay make money if it's completely free?
Our business model is built around strategic partnerships, not student payments. We believe charging students for essential academic tools is fundamentally wrong, so we've structured our company to generate revenue without ever asking students for money.

**Strategic Partnerships**: We work with companies and organizations that want to support student success. These partners value access to our platform for recruitment, providing student deals, or understanding aggregate trends in education. Importantly, these partnerships never compromise student privacy or control over their data.

**Recruitment Connections**: Companies desperately want to connect with talented college students. When students opt-in, we can facilitate these connections in a privacy-preserving way. Students control what's shared and benefit from exclusive opportunities. Companies pay for access to connect with interested students, never for personal data.

**Aggregate Analytics**: Educational institutions and researchers can benefit from understanding trends in student behavior - what causes stress, what improves outcomes, what resources students actually need. We provide completely anonymized, aggregated insights that help improve education while protecting individual privacy. This is always opt-in and never identifies individuals.

**Future Services**: We're exploring B2B services that support our free student platform, such as tools for tutors, educational content creators, or campus organizations. These would generate revenue from professional users while keeping the student experience completely free.

The key is alignment - every revenue stream must make the platform better for students, not worse. We're not doing traditional advertising. No banner ads, no selling data, no compromising the user experience for revenue. Our success depends on student success.

### Will you sell my data or show me ads?
Never. We don't sell personal data, and we don't do traditional advertising. No banner ads, no video ads, no sponsored content disguised as recommendations. Your academic experience in DormWay won't be interrupted by advertisements.

When we talk about strategic partnerships, we mean thoughtful collaborations that actually benefit students. For example, if a local bookstore wants to offer discounts to students who need specific textbooks, and you've opted in to receive such offers, we might facilitate that connection. But this is always opt-in, always relevant, and never intrusive.

Your data is not our product - you are not our product. DormWay is our product, and we monetize through B2B partnerships that respect your privacy and enhance your experience. Any data sharing for analytics is aggregated beyond any possibility of identification and only happens with explicit opt-in consent.

We've built our entire business model around this principle. Selling data or showing traditional ads would destroy the trust that makes DormWay valuable. It would also go against everything we believe about education technology.

### Why is DormWay free for all features?
Making DormWay 100% free isn't charity - it's our core philosophy and business strategy. We believe this approach builds the most valuable company while providing the most benefit to students and society.

First, there's the moral imperative. College is already expensive enough. Students are taking on massive debt just to get an education. Charging them more money for tools to manage that education is wrong. Every student deserves the best tools to succeed, regardless of their financial situation.

Second, network effects only work at scale. If DormWay cost money, we'd have a smaller user base, and the platform would be less valuable for everyone. By being completely free, we can reach all 20 million college students, creating collective intelligence that benefits everyone.

Third, it aligns with our mission. We're not trying to extract maximum revenue from students. We're trying to make college more manageable, more successful, and less stressful for an entire generation. That only works if everyone can use it.

Fourth, it's sustainable through our partnership model. We don't need student payments to build a successful company. Our strategic partnerships and B2B services can support the platform while keeping it free for students.

Finally, it's the competitive advantage. While other platforms nickel-and-dime students with subscriptions and premium tiers, we're building trust and loyalty by being genuinely free. When students graduate and become professionals, they'll remember that DormWay was there for them without asking for payment.

## Support

### How do I get help?
We've built multiple support channels to ensure you get help quickly and effectively, regardless of your issue or preferred communication style.

**Email Support (support@dormway.app)**: Our primary support channel, monitored by real humans who understand both the technical and academic aspects of DormWay. We aim to respond within 24-48 hours. Our support team isn't outsourced - they're DormWay team members who deeply understand the product and can actually solve your problems.

**In-App Help**: Context-sensitive help is built into every feature. Stuck on something? Click the help icon for immediate guidance specific to what you're trying to do. This isn't just static FAQ content - it's dynamic help that understands your situation and provides relevant solutions.

**AI Assistant**: For immediate answers to common questions, our AI assistant can help 24/7. It's trained on our entire knowledge base and can answer questions about features, troubleshoot common issues, and guide you through complex workflows. If the AI can't resolve your issue, it seamlessly escalates to human support.

**Community Forums** (coming soon): Connect with other DormWay users, share tips, and get peer support. Our most engaged users often have creative solutions and workarounds that even we haven't thought of. Forums are moderated to ensure they remain helpful and respectful.

**DormWay Ambassadors** (at select schools): At universities with high DormWay adoption, we have student ambassadors who can provide in-person help, run workshops, and gather feedback. They're fellow students who deeply understand both DormWay and your specific campus environment.

### I found a bug. How do I report it?
We love bug reports - seriously! Every bug report helps us make DormWay better for millions of students. We've made reporting bugs as easy as possible while ensuring we get the information needed to fix issues quickly.

**Email bugs@dormway.app** with as much detail as possible. The perfect bug report includes: what you were trying to do, what you expected to happen, what actually happened, what device/browser you're using, and if possible, screenshots or screen recordings. Don't worry about being too technical - just describe the issue in your own words.

**In-App Bug Reporter** (coming soon): We're building a tool that lets you report bugs directly from DormWay with automatic context capture. It'll grab technical details like your browser version and recent actions (not personal data) to help us reproduce the issue.

**Severity Levels**: We triage bugs based on impact. Critical bugs affecting core functionality or data integrity are fixed immediately, often within hours. Major bugs are addressed within days. Minor issues and feature requests are prioritized based on how many users they affect.

**Bug Bounty Program**: For security-related bugs, we offer rewards ranging from $100 to $10,000 depending on severity. If you find a security vulnerability, please report it to security@dormway.app. We promise safe harbor for good-faith security research - you won't get in trouble for responsibly disclosing security issues.

**Feedback Loop**: When you report a bug, you're not sending it into a void. We acknowledge receipt, keep you updated on progress, and let you know when it's fixed. For significant bugs, we often reach out to reporters to beta test fixes before full deployment.

**Public Bug Tracker** (planned): We're working on a public bug tracker where you can see known issues, their status, and planned fix dates. Transparency helps you understand what we're working on and whether an issue you're experiencing is already known.

### Can DormWay work with my university's IT department?
Absolutely! We actively encourage collaboration with university IT departments and have designed DormWay to be IT-friendly from the ground up. We understand that IT departments have legitimate concerns about security, privacy, and integration, and we're prepared to address all of them.

**Security Documentation**: We provide comprehensive security documentation including our SOC 2 compliance reports, penetration testing results, encryption specifications, and FERPA compliance attestations. IT departments can review our security posture in detail before students start using DormWay.

**Integration Support**: We work with IT teams to ensure smooth LMS integration without compromising university security. We support standard protocols like LTI (Learning Tools Interoperability), OAuth, and SAML for authentication. We never ask for administrative credentials or broad access - we use the minimum permissions necessary.

**Enterprise Agreements** (optional): While DormWay is free for students, universities can opt for enterprise agreements that provide additional benefits like priority support for their students, custom integrations, enhanced analytics dashboards, and direct technical support channels.

**IT Partnership Program**: We offer a partnership program where IT departments get direct access to our engineering team, advance notice of new features, input on roadmap priorities, and the ability to beta test features before campus-wide rollout.

**Compliance and Auditing**: We welcome security audits and compliance reviews. We can provide audit logs, compliance certificates, and detailed technical documentation. We also carry appropriate cyber insurance and can be added to university vendor management systems.

Have your IT department contact partnerships@dormway.app to start the conversation. We typically begin with a technical review call where we can address specific concerns and demonstrate our security measures.

### My campus isn't fully supported yet. When will it be?
DormWay works for students at every college from day one - the core features like syllabus parsing, schedule management, and study tools are universally available. When we talk about "full campus support," we mean the hyperlocal features that require critical mass and specific campus data.

**What's available everywhere immediately**:
- Syllabus processing and calendar sync
- ICS file import from your LMS
- Assignment tracking and study planning
- AI-powered academic assistance
- Basic campus maps and navigation
- Study group coordination

**What requires campus-specific support**:
- Real-time dining hall menus and wait times
- Building occupancy and best study spot recommendations  
- Campus event integration and recommendations
- Local business deals and student discounts
- University-specific resource locations and hours
- Hyperlocal transit and parking information

**How campuses get full support**: It's driven entirely by student adoption. When we reach approximately 100 users at a campus, we begin adding basic campus-specific features. At 500 users, we add dining and events. At 1,000+ users, we activate all hyperlocal features and often assign a dedicated campus success manager.

**Accelerate support for your campus**: The fastest way to get full support is to invite your friends. Every new user from your campus gets us closer to the threshold for enhanced features. You can also become a DormWay Ambassador to help drive adoption and provide local insights that improve the platform for your school.

**Timeline**: We're adding full support to 2-3 new campuses per week, prioritizing based on user growth rates and engagement. If your campus has rapid adoption, you could have full support within weeks. We're transparent about this process - you can check your campus status in the app to see how close you are to different feature thresholds.

The beauty of our model is that you don't have to wait for your university's approval or for us to negotiate contracts. Start using DormWay today, invite your friends, and watch as features automatically unlock for your campus.

## Community

### What is DormWay Ambassadors?
DormWay Ambassadors are passionate students who help spread DormWay at their campus and provide crucial feedback that shapes the platform's development. It's not just a marketing program - it's a genuine partnership between us and the students who best understand their campus's needs.

Ambassadors help their fellow students discover DormWay, run study sessions to show how to get the most from the platform, gather feedback about what features would be most valuable for their specific campus, and serve as the voice of their university within our product development process.

What Ambassadors get in return: Early access to new features before anyone else, direct communication with our founding team, the opportunity to shape a product used by millions, valuable experience in product development and growth marketing, and recognition as campus leaders in education technology.

We're looking for students who are genuinely excited about making college better for everyone, not just people who want a résumé line item. The best Ambassadors are those who've experienced the chaos of managing college life and want to help their peers avoid the same struggles.

If you're interested in becoming an Ambassador, we want students who are organized, passionate about technology and education, connected within their campus community, and excited about DormWay's mission to make college manageable for everyone. Reach out to ambassadors@dormway.app with a brief note about why you're interested and what makes you a good fit for your campus.

## About DormWay

### Who made DormWay?
DormWay was created by two people: Riley Crimmins, a University of Michigan student who lived the daily chaos of managing college life, and Ethan Kaplan, a career music tech executive who's spent decades building consumer platforms. And yes, just the two of us built everything you see.

The origin story is almost absurd: it basically started as a joke. Riley was drowning in syllabi and deadlines, Ethan was exploring AI capabilities, and somewhere between frustration and caffeine, we realized we could build something that actually solved this problem. Not another calendar app or to-do list, but an intelligent platform that understands the unique challenges of college life.

Riley brought the authentic student perspective - knowing exactly what features matter, what's annoying about existing tools, and what students actually need versus what administrators think they need. Ethan brought decades of experience building platforms at scale, understanding user behavior, and knowing how to leverage AI effectively.

The combination works because we're not trying to build what we think students need - Riley IS a student. And we're not building another corporate education product - we're building something rebelliously simple and powerful. No committees, no focus groups, no venture capital demanding growth at all costs. Just two people who thought college should be easier to manage.

### How did two people make this?
The honest answer involves three key ingredients: careful use of AI, a lot of caffeine, and strategic cleverness about what to build and what not to build.

**AI as a Force Multiplier**: We didn't just use AI as a feature - we used it as a development partner. AI helped us write code faster, debug more efficiently, design better user experiences, and even think through complex problems. When you know how to leverage AI properly, two people can build like a team of twenty.

**Focus on What Matters**: We didn't try to build everything. No bloated features, no checkbox requirements from university administrators, no legacy system compatibility. We built exactly what students need and nothing more. This focused approach meant we could move incredibly fast.

**Modern Development Stack**: We chose technologies that let us move fast: SwiftUI for iOS, TypeScript for the API, Temporal for complex workflows. Modern frameworks and cloud services mean you don't need a huge team to build robust, scalable applications.

**Caffeine and Determination**: We're not going to lie - there were a lot of late nights, endless coffee, and moments where we questioned our sanity. But we were motivated by a simple truth: every day we delayed was another day students struggled with manageable problems.

**No Corporate Overhead**: No meetings about meetings. No product committees. No stakeholder alignment sessions. When you have an idea at 2 AM, you can implement it by 3 AM. This agility is impossible in traditional development teams.

The result is a platform built by students, for students, without the compromise and complexity that comes from traditional development. We're proof that with the right tools, determination, and clarity of vision, you don't need a huge team to build something transformative.

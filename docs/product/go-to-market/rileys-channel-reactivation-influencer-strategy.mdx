## HOW RILEY COMPARES TO TARGET INFLUENCERS

|Creator|Platform|Followers|Riley's Position|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Riley**|TikTok|58K|Baseline|
|Stephanie|YouTube|36K|Riley has 1.6x more|
|Jade Bahng|TikTok|24K|Riley has 2.4x more|
|Phedra Dee|YouTube|103K|Riley = 56%|
|Taylor Dodd-Owens|TikTok|138K|Riley = 42%|
|College Life Podcast|Podcast|Small/engaged|Different medium|

**Key Insight**: Riley already has more reach than several micro-influencers we identified. He should activate his own audience at mobile launch, then approach others from a position of proven traction.

## THE THREE-PHASE STRATEGY

### PHASE 1: QUIET GROWTH (Now - December)

**Current state**: Web app beta, organic user acquisition, B2B outreach

### PHASE 2: BUILD ANTICIPATION (December - Early January)

**Goal**: Create mystery and anticipation for new semester launch

### PHASE 3: FULL REACTIVATION (January Mobile Launch)

**Goal**: Capitalize on new semester timing with polished mobile app

---

## PHASE 1: QUIET GROWTH (Now - December)

### Current Activities (Continue)

- Web app beta with student users
- Organic campus growth at UMich
- B2B outreach (partnerships, campus organizations)
- Product refinement based on feedback
- Building feature set for mobile

### Riley's Minimal Social Presence

**Frequency**: 1-2 posts per month maximum

**Content Themes**: "Mystery Documentary"

- **Don't**: Explain what you're building, demo product, ask for signups, tell the "why I stopped" story
- **Do**: Document journey vaguely, show work in progress, build intrigue

**TikTok Examples** (1 per month):

```
Post 1: "Late night coding session"
- 10-second clip of laptop screen with code
- Dark room, just screen glow
- Text: "Building something"
- No explanation

Post 2: "When your code finally works"
- Reaction clip (relief/excitement)
- Text: "3am victories"
- Still no context

Post 3: "Student life"
- Montage: Class → Laptop → Repeat
- Text: "Balancing both"
- Mysterious
```

**Instagram Stories** (Weekly):

- Screenshot of code (no explanation)
- "Back to this after class" desk shot
- Whiteboard brainstorming (vague)
- Coffee + laptop late night
- Keep followers aware you exist but curious

**Twitter** (Bi-weekly):

- "Learning SwiftUI is humbling"
- "Shipping features students actually ask for"
- Technical observations (no product details)

**Purpose**:

- Accounts don't go fully dormant (algorithm friendly)
- Documents journey for later content
- Builds anticipation/mystery
- Shows you're working on something serious

### Influencer Strategy - Phase 1

**DO reach out to**:

- Parent influencers (Grown and Flown, College Parents of America)
- Podcasts with long lead times (Harlan Cohen, College Info Geek)
- B2B partnerships (campus organizations, academic advisors)

**Pitch framework for Phase 1**:

```
"I'm Riley, U-M student building DormWay - productivity platform for college students. 

Web beta live with 1,000+ Michigan students. Mobile launching January for spring semester.

Would love to chat about [their specific focus area] or feature it in January when we have mobile ready."
```

**DON'T**:

- Do massive student influencer outreach yet (save for mobile launch)
- Reactivate channels (save the story)
- Push for immediate features (you're building toward January)

**Goal**: Plant seeds, build relationships, schedule features for January

---

## PHASE 2: BUILD ANTICIPATION (December 15 - January 5)

### Week of December 15: First Teases

**TikTok** (2 posts this week):

```
Post 1: "Announcement coming"
- Face camera, serious look
- Text: "Been building something for 6 months"
- Text: "Launching in January"
- No details yet

Post 2: "Remember when I streamed?"
- Old streaming clips montage
- Text: "I stopped for a reason"
- Text: "You'll see why soon"
```

**Instagram Stories**:

- Series of 5 frames
- Frame 1: Old streaming setup photo
- Frame 2: "I stopped streaming"
- Frame 3: "To build something"
- Frame 4: "January"
- Frame 5: "Stay tuned"

**Twitter Thread**:

```
Big announcement coming in January.

I stopped streaming 6 months ago because I couldn't manage it + UMich.

So I learned to code and built something.

It's almost ready. New semester, new launch.

More soon.
```

### Week of December 22: Holiday Timing

**Social media quiet** (people off for holidays)

- Maybe 1 story: "Working through break"
- Focus on finishing mobile app

### Week of December 29: New Year Build-Up

**TikTok**:

```
"New year, new launch"
- Quick clips of App Store screenshots (blurred)
- Text: "Been waiting to show you this"
- Text: "Next week"
```

**Instagram**:

- Story countdown: "7 days"
- Each day: Different preview (still mysterious)
- Day 7: App icon reveal
- Day 3: Feature tease
- Day 1: "Tomorrow"

### January 2-5: Final Build-Up (Classes Resume)

**TikTok** (Daily posts):

```
Monday: "Classes start, so does this"
Tuesday: "You asked where I've been"
Wednesday: "I stopped streaming to build an app"
Thursday: "It launches tomorrow"
```

**Timing note**: Most students return to campus January 5-10. Time the launch for maximum campus presence.

## WHY THIS TIMELINE WORKS

### Semester Timing

- **January launch** = perfect timing for spring semester
- Students setting up new schedules
- New classes, new syllabi
- Fresh start energy
- "New year, new tools" mentality

### Product Readiness

- Mobile app polished and stable
- iPad optimization for students
- Viral mechanics built-in
- Onboarding smooth
- Can handle traffic spike

### Story Completeness

- "I stopped streaming to build this" → payoff is mobile app
- Web beta = building phase (not the story)
- Mobile = the achievement worth the sacrifice
- Clean narrative arc

### Competitive Timing

- Beat competitors to spring semester
- First-mover advantage for new students
- Build habits early in semester
- Network effects compound over term

---

## BACKUP PLANS

### If Mobile Delayed Past January

- **Minor delay (1-2 weeks)**: Still launch, mention "Spring semester launch"
- **Major delay (1+ month)**: Abort full reactivation, continue Phase 1 mystery content until ready
- **Critical**: Don't blow the story on an unfinished product

### If Metrics Disappoint on Launch

- **Low downloads Week 1**: Focus on organic campus growth, don't push influencer outreach yet
- **Poor App Store rating**: Fix issues immediately, light outreach only after 4.5+ stars
- **Low engagement**: Iterate messaging, test different content approaches before broader push

### If Something Goes Viral Early

- **Documentary content goes viral**: Lean in, release more build content, accelerate timeline if possible
- **Beta user creates content**: Amplify it, but don't fully reveal yet - maintain mystery

---

## NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

### This Week

- [ ] Film 1-2 "building in progress" posts for November/December
- [ ] Start pulling old Twitch VODs for later use
- [ ] Draft Discord announcement for December
- [ ] Outline full Twitter thread for launch
- [ ] Schedule Harlan Cohen / podcast outreach for early January

### December

- [ ] Film all B-roll (campus, dorm, app demos)
- [ ] Record all launch TikToks (can edit in January)
- [ ] Test streaming setup for comeback stream
- [ ] Prep comeback stream format/talking points
- [ ] Write outreach emails (don't send yet)

### Early January (Launch Week)

- [ ] Execute full shot list across all platforms
- [ ] Post daily during launch week
- [ ] Engage with every comment/DM
- [ ] Monitor metrics closely
- [ ] Comeback stream Day 5

### Week 2+

- [ ] Start influencer outreach with metrics
- [ ] Regular content cadence begins
- [ ] Iterate based on feedback
- [ ] Scale what works

---

## THE BOTTOM LINE

**Don't reactivate until January mobile launch.** The story is too valuable to waste on beta web app.

**Between now and January**: Stay minimally visible, document the journey mysteriously, finish the product.

**January**: Full force reactivation with polished mobile app timed perfectly to spring semester when students need it most.

**Then**: Use proven traction to approach influencers from position of strength.

You only get one comeback. Make it count.

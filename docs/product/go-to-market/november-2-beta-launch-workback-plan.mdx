### Social Media Content

#### Instagram Main Post (Nov 2, 6 PM — Sunday Evening)
**Caption Draft (Riley Voice):**
```
Sunday scaries hitting different? We just launched DormWay 🚀

Built this because Sunday nights were the worst — that anxiety about everything due this week.
No idea what's on Canvas, what's in syllabi, what's in my email. Just stress.

So I made DormWay.

Upload syllabi. Connect Canvas. See everything.
Do Now. Up Next. Due Soon.

8 weeks left in the semester. Start Monday confident, not stressed.

Built by a student who gets the Sunday scaries.
Works at 6,134 schools.

Link in bio to beat the Sunday scaries (it's free)

[Tag: @dormway #DormWay #SundayScaries #StudentLife #ForStudentsByStudents]

Canvas has some assignments
Syllabi PDFs have others
Email has random updates
Your brain: "Did I forget something? I definitely forgot something."

[Solution - 10-20s]
So I built DormWay
Upload syllabi → email them to syllabus@dormway.app
Connect Canvas → automatic import
See everything → Do Now. Up Next. Due Soon.

[CTA - 20-25s]
Link in bio. Free. Beat the Sunday scaries.
Start Monday confident 💪

## Brand Guidelines Update: "For Students, By Students"

### Core Principles (Riley-Led)

#### 1. Voice & Tone

**We sound like:**
- A helpful classmate, not a corporation
- Real talk, not marketing speak
- Encouraging but honest
- "I've been there" empathy

**We don't sound like:**
- A startup pitch deck
- A corporate press release
- An overly enthusiastic sales email
- Condescending "adulting" advice

**Example Transformations:**

❌ **Before:** "DormWay leverages cutting-edge AI to optimize your academic workflow"
✅ **After:** "We built DormWay to help you actually stay on top of deadlines"

❌ **Before:** "Maximize your productivity with our revolutionary platform"
✅ **After:** "Stop missing stuff. See everything in one place."

❌ **Before:** "Join thousands of students transforming their academic journey"
✅ **After:** "Built by a student who kept forgetting assignments. Now 6,000+ use it."

#### 2. Messaging Hierarchy

**Always lead with:**
1. Real student problem (relatable, specific)
2. How we solve it (simple, clear)
3. Built by students (authenticity, trust)

**Never lead with:**
1. Technology/AI features
2. Awards or accolades
3. Investment or company milestones
4. "Revolutionary" claims

#### 3. Visual Brand

**Student-First Aesthetics:**
- Clean, minimalist (students hate clutter)
- Dark mode by default (late-night studying)
- Real campus photos (not stock imagery)
- Riley's face in founder content (builds trust)

**Avoid:**
- Corporate stock photos of "students"
- Overly polished marketing visuals
- Generic office/tech aesthetics
- Anything that feels "selling to students" vs. "built for students"

#### 4. Content Approval Checklist (RileyGPT Standard)

**Before publishing any content, verify ALL of these:**

**The Riley Test (Primary):**
- [ ] Would Riley say this to a friend?
- [ ] Does this sound like a real student wrote it?
- [ ] Is it friendly first, credible second, never corporate?

**RileyGPT Style Mechanics:**
- [ ] **Clear one-sentence point up top** — what's the main thing?
- [ ] **Proof with specifics** — numbers, dates, examples (receipts)
- [ ] **Concise sentences** — average 10-15 words, some shorter for punch
- [ ] **Scannable bullets/headers** — can you skim and get it?
- [ ] **One clear CTA** — what should they do next?
- [ ] **Jargon trimmed or explained** — would a freshman understand this?
- [ ] **Exactly one humanizing touch** — em dash, parenthetical aside, or light joke

**Content Structure (Why → So What → Now What):**
- [ ] **Why:** Context and importance established
- [ ] **So what:** Impact clearly stated
- [ ] **Now what:** Next steps or CTA obvious

**Voice Alignment:**
- [ ] Problem-first (not feature-first)
- [ ] Specific details (not generic claims)
- [ ] Plain English with active verbs
- [ ] No corporate jargon or buzzwords

**If ALL boxes checked → Publish**

**If ANY box unchecked → Edit and re-check**

**See full RileyGPT specifications:** `Voice-Guidelines-For-Students-By-Students.md`

#### 5. Prohibited Words/Phrases

**Never use:**
- "Leverage" (just say "use")
- "Ecosystem" (say "platform" or "app")
- "Synergy" (delete entirely)
- "Game-changer" / "Revolutionary" (overused, unbelievable)
- "Empower" (condescending, corporate)
- "Cutting-edge" (marketing speak)
- "Transform your academic journey" (too grandiose)
- "Unlock your potential" (eye-roll territory)

**Use instead:**
- "Actually helps you..."
- "Built because we needed it"
- "Stop missing stuff"
- "See everything in one place"
- "From a student who gets it"

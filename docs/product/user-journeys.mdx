# User Journeys

Canonical, end-to-end flows to validate our product experience in production-like environments.

## 1) PLG (Product-Led Growth) Entry
- Trigger: Student submits email or forwards a syllabus email.
- System: Creates/ensures account, collects early signals.
- Admin: Use [PLG Spot Check](/docs/operations/runbooks/plg-spot-check) to scope by domain and preview cleanup (dry run) before applying.
- Success: Single student context, inferred campus (provisional), no duplicates.

## 2) Sign Up (Full Registration)
- Trigger: Student signs up via app.
- System: Auth + account linking with prior PLG identity.
- Success: No duplicate accounts/contexts; onboarding status updated.

## 3) Schedule Upload (ICS)
- Trigger: Student connects calendar/ICS.
- System: Ingests events; stores preferences; dedupes.
- Success: Events visible; re‑uploads are idempotent; no doubles.

## 4) Syllabus Upload
- Trigger: Student uploads PDF.
- System: Processes via workflows; derives course code/title; attaches to course context; links to campus.
- Admin: [Syllabus Campus Linker](/docs/operations/runbooks/syllabus-campus-linker) to preview JSON/PDF and adjust campus links if needed.
- Success: Course context reused if code matches; campus link correct; no duplicates.

## 5) Term Processing
- System: Aggregates courses into the current term; normalizes metadata.
- Success: Consistent course roll‑up under campus; stable codes.

## 6) Notes
- Trigger: Student or admin adds notes to syllabus/course/user.
- Success: Persisted; visible where relevant; audit trail maintained.

## 7) Term Reprocessing
- Trigger: Data changes require re-run (e.g., syllabus updated).
- System: Reprocesses idempotently; preserves identities and links.
- Success: No duplication of courses or campus links.

## Operations Guidance
- Use dry runs in PLG Spot Check before any batch action.
- Avoid creating new campuses from registry; link to existing contexts.
- Prefer domain filters for prod-wide actions.

## Release Timing Strategy

### Primary Release Moments (Maximum Social Saturation)

**Why:**
- Students have free time (exams done or grades in)
- High emotional investment (relief, celebration, reflection)
- Natural sharing moment (bragging rights, parent updates)
- Concentrated timing = social feed saturation
- Everyone gets theirs at same time = FOMO effect

**Trigger:**
- Option A: 2 days before first final exam (during study period)
- Option B: Day after final grades posted to university registrar
- Recommendation: **Option A** - Stress relief moment, study break content

**Notification:**
- Push: "Your Fall 2025 Semester Wrapped is ready! 🎉"
- Email: "You made it through another semester - see how far you came"

---

#### 2. **Mid-Semester** - "Halfway There Check-In"

```typescript
interface StudentStats {
  // BrainGains
  totalDocuments: number
  totalPages: number
  totalQueries: number
  documentTypeBreakdown: Record<string, number>
  mostActiveUploadDays: string[]

  // Syllabus/Semester

  // vs. average DormWay user
  documentUploadPercentile: number // 0-100
  organizationPercentile: number

  // vs. previous semester (if available)
  documentsChange: number // percentage
  assignmentsChange: number
  adherenceChange: number
}
```

#### 3. **Personality Profiling**
```typescript
type LearningStyle =
  | "Note Taker"      // High note uploads
  | "Strategic Planner" // High schedule adherence
  | "Night Owl Scholar" // Late study times
  | "Early Bird"      // Early study times
  | "Grind Mode"      // High workload, high completion
  | "Balanced Student" // Even distribution

    examCount: number
    projectCount: number
  }>

  // Habit detection
  studyTimeDistribution: Record<string, number> // hour -> count
  mostCommonStudyLocation?: string // if we have location data
}
```

---

### Data Enrichment Pipelines

#### Pipeline 1: Semester Wrap Preparation
**Trigger:** 1 week before semester end
**Process:**
1. Query all user activity from semester start to current date
2. Calculate aggregate statistics
3. Identify peak weeks from workload analysis
4. Determine learning style/persona
5. Generate comparative stats (vs. average, vs. previous semester)
6. Store in `service_data` table with method='semester_wrap_data'

**Storage Schema:**
```typescript
{
  method: 'semester_wrap_data',
  data: {
    term: string,          // "Fall 2024"
    stats: StudentStats,
    comparative: ComparativeStats,
    persona: StudyPersona,
    temporal: TemporalInsights,
    generatedAt: string
  }
}
```

---

#### Pipeline 2: Video Generation Queue
**Trigger:** Release timing hit (e.g., 2 days before finals)
**Process:**
1. Fetch pre-computed wrap data from `service_data`
2. Enqueue video generation job for each active user
3. Process via React Remotion rendering service
4. Store video in S3
5. Create notification with video link

**Queue Structure:**
```typescript
interface VideoRenderJob {
  userId: string
  term: string
  videoType: 'semester_wrapped' | 'midterm_checkin' | 'year_review'
  data: StudentStats
  customization: {
    schoolColors?: [string, string]
    musicEnabled: boolean
    skipStats?: string[] // privacy
  }
  outputFormat: {
    platform: 'instagram' | 'tiktok' | 'twitter' | 'youtube'
    aspectRatio: '9:16' | '16:9'
    duration: number // seconds
  }
}
```

---

## Technical Implementation

### React Remotion Architecture

#### 1. **Video Components**
```typescript
// apps/dormway-platform/packages/video-renderer/

src/
  compositions/
    SemesterWrapped.tsx        // Main semester wrap video
    MidtermCheckin.tsx         // Mid-semester check-in
    YearInReview.tsx           // Academic year recap
    FirstWeekSurvival.tsx      // Week 1 complete

  components/
    shared/
      StatReveal.tsx           // Animated number reveal
      ProgressBar.tsx          // Animated progress bars
      ChartAnimation.tsx       // Chart/graph animations
      ConfettiEffect.tsx       // Celebration animations
      SchoolBranding.tsx       // School colors/logo

    slides/
      OpeningSlide.tsx
      StatsSlide.tsx
      HighlightsSlide.tsx
      PersonalitySlide.tsx
      ClosingSlide.tsx

  utils/
    dataFormatters.ts          // Format stats for display
    colorPalettes.ts           // School color schemes
    animations.ts              // Reusable animation configs

  templates/
    instagram-story.tsx        // 9:16 template
    tiktok.tsx                 // 9:16 with TikTok safe zones
    twitter.tsx                // 16:9 template
    youtube-shorts.tsx         // 9:16 YouTube optimized
```

#### 2. **Rendering Service**
```typescript
// services/video-render-service/

interface RenderRequest {
  composition: string      // 'SemesterWrapped'
  props: StudentStats
  outputFormat: VideoFormat
  userId: string
}

async function renderVideo(request: RenderRequest): Promise<string> {
  // 1. Validate data
  // 2. Generate Remotion composition with props
  // 3. Render video (serverless or local)
  // 4. Upload to S3
  // 5. Return public URL
}
```

#### 3. **Queue Worker**
Use BullMQ or similar:
```typescript
// Worker processes video render jobs
videoQueue.process(async (job) => {
  const { userId, term, videoType, data } = job.data

  // Render video
  const videoUrl = await renderVideo({
    composition: videoType,
    props: data,
    outputFormat: determineFormat(job.data.platform),
    userId
  })

  // Create notification
  await createNotification({
    userId,
    type: 'video_ready',
    title: 'Your Semester Wrapped is ready! 🎉',
    deepLink: `/wrapped/${term}`,
    data: { videoUrl }
  })

  // Track analytics
  await trackEvent('video_generated', { userId, videoType, term })
})
```

---

### Database Schema Updates

#### Store Video Records
```sql
CREATE TABLE student_wrapped_videos (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id),
  term TEXT NOT NULL,              -- "Fall 2024"
  video_type TEXT NOT NULL,        -- 'semester_wrapped', 'midterm_checkin', etc.
  video_url TEXT NOT NULL,         -- S3 URL
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  stats JSONB NOT NULL,            -- StudentStats used to generate
  viewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  shared BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  share_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  platform_shares JSONB,           -- {"instagram": 3, "tiktok": 1}
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  expires_at TIMESTAMPTZ           -- Auto-delete after 90 days?
);

CREATE INDEX idx_wrapped_videos_user_term ON student_wrapped_videos(user_id, term);
```

---

## Privacy & Ethics Considerations

### 1. **Opt-Out Mechanism**
- User settings: "Disable Wrapped videos" toggle
- Honor opt-out before generating/notifying

### 2. **Data Sensitivity**
- Don't reveal actual grades (we don't have them anyway)
- Don't share stress/mental health inferences
- Avoid language that could make struggling students feel worse
- Positive framing: focus on effort, not outcomes

### 3. **Customization**
- Let users hide specific stats before sharing
- Option to regenerate with different stats
- Delete video permanently

### 4. **Consent**
- First-time: Explain what Wrapped is, get consent
- Remind: "This will be shared publicly if you post it"

---

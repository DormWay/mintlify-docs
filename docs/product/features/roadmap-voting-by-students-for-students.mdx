## Executive Summary

DormWay's native roadmap voting and feature request system gives students **direct control over product development**. Students can vote on upcoming features, submit their own ideas, and see real-time results—no corporate middleman, no external platform. This is student democracy in action: **your votes directly shape what we build next**.

**Core Philosophy:** Traditional software companies decide what students need. We let students decide what students want.

---

## The "By Students, For Students" Vision

### What Makes This Different

Most EdTech companies say they "listen to students." We **give students the steering wheel**.

| Traditional EdTech | DormWay Roadmap Voting |
|-------------------|----------------------|
| Anonymous surveys once a year | Real-time voting every day |
| Product managers decide priorities | Student votes decide priorities |
| Feedback goes into a black hole | Public roadmap shows what's coming |
| No transparency on what's being built | Full visibility into development plans |
| Feature requests via support tickets | Dedicated public feature request board |
| Students never know if ideas were heard | Vote counts update live, Linear integration auto-creates issues at 25+ votes |

### Core Principles

1. **Radical Transparency**
   Students can see exactly what we're building, when we expect to ship it, and why we prioritized it. No hidden agendas, no corporate secrets.

2. **Democratic Prioritization**
   The most-voted features rise to the top. We don't ignore small-but-passionate groups, but we also won't build for one person at the expense of thousands.

3. **Student Ownership**
   This is YOUR product. You pay (or will pay) for it, you use it daily, you should decide how it evolves.

4. **Accountability**
   When students vote for a feature and we build it, we notify everyone who voted. When we decide NOT to build something, we explain why publicly.

5. **No External Dependencies**
   We built this ourselves instead of using Canny.io or ProductBoard. Why? Because third-party platforms limit what we can do, cost monthly fees, and put a layer between us and students.

## How It Works

### For Students

#### 1️⃣ Vote on Roadmap Features
**Where:** `/roadmap` in LockedIn web app
**What:** See upcoming features we're building (Now, Next, Later)
**Action:** Click the up-arrow to vote on features you want most

**Restrictions:**
- ✅ Can vote on: Upcoming/Planned features (future-dated)
- ❌ Cannot vote on: Completed or In-Progress features (that's what changelogs are for)
- 🔐 Must be signed in: Redirects to `/sign-in` for anonymous users

**Real-time Updates:**
- Your vote appears instantly (optimistic UI)
- Other students' votes update in real-time via Ably pub/sub
- Purple glow effect shows items you've voted for
- Vote counts sync across all open tabs/devices

#### 2️⃣ Submit Feature Requests
**Where:** `/feedback/submit-feature` (Phase 2 - complete)
**What:** Propose your own feature ideas
**Action:** Write description, add category tags, submit for community voting

**Features:**
- Full-text search to avoid duplicates
- Category tagging (mobile, web, ai, integrations, etc.)
- Comment threads for discussion
- Upvote other students' ideas

#### 3️⃣ Track Feature Status
**Where:** Feature request detail pages
**What:** See if your idea is being considered, planned, or built
**Updates:** Automatic notifications when status changes

**Lifecycle:**
- **New** → Just submitted, gathering votes
- **Under Review** → Team is evaluating feasibility
- **Planned** → Added to roadmap with target quarter
- **In Progress** → Actively being built (linked to Linear issue)
- **Shipped** → Live in production, voters notified
- **Won't Build** → Declined with public explanation

### For The DormWay Team

#### Admin Dashboard (Phase 3 - complete)
- Review and moderate feature requests
- Link high-vote requests to Linear issues (auto-creates at 25+ votes)
- Update statuses and add team comments
- Analyze vote patterns and trends
- Bulk operations for request management

#### Automated Workflows
- 25+ votes → Auto-create Linear issue with `user-request` label
- Feature shipped → Notify all voters via email/in-app
- Monthly digest: "Top community requests this month"

## Key Talking Points

### For Marketing & Social Media

**1. Student Democracy in Action**
> "Most apps are built by executives in boardrooms. DormWay is built by the students who use it. Literally. Your votes = our roadmap."

**2. Radical Transparency**
> "See exactly what we're building at dormway.app/roadmap. No secrets, no surprise features you didn't ask for. If it's on the roadmap, you put it there."

**3. Your Voice Matters**
> "25 students vote for a feature? It goes straight to our dev team's backlog. No forms, no waiting, no 'we'll consider it.' Real votes → Real features."

**4. Built Different**
> "We could've used a third-party tool like other companies. Instead, we built it ourselves so students get real-time updates, complete transparency, and zero corporate BS."

**5. Accountability Culture**
> "When we ship a feature you voted for, we tell you. When we decide not to build something, we explain why publicly. That's the difference between saying you listen and actually listening."

### For Onboarding & User Education

**First-Time User Messaging:**
> "Welcome to DormWay! Here's something different: YOU get to decide what we build next. Head to the Roadmap and vote on upcoming features. Got an idea we're missing? Submit it and rally the community to vote."

**In-App Prompts:**
- After uploading 3rd syllabus: "Loving DormWay? Vote on upcoming features at /roadmap"
- After 1 week of use: "You've been using DormWay for a week! Help shape what we build next—submit a feature request"
- After completing schedule: "Want better schedule features? Tell us what to build at /feedback"

**Email Campaigns:**
- **Subject:** "You're not just a user—you're a co-creator"
- **Body:** "Every vote shapes our roadmap. Every feature request gets reviewed. This is student-driven product development, and your voice matters. Vote now: [link]"

### For Investor & Press Communications

**Product-Market Fit Story:**
> "Traditional product development relies on surveys and focus groups. We've inverted that model: students vote in real-time on what we build, and our roadmap reflects community consensus. This creates unprecedented alignment between what users want and what we ship."

**Competitive Differentiation:**
> "While competitors use third-party feedback tools (Canny, ProductBoard), we built a native system integrated directly into our stack. This enables real-time voting, sub-100ms updates via Ably, and seamless authentication with our existing Clerk infrastructure. Students aren't leaving our app to give feedback—it's part of the core experience."

**Community Building:**
> "The roadmap voting system isn't just about gathering feedback. It's about building a community of students who feel ownership over the product. When a student's feature request gets 50 votes and we ship it 3 weeks later, that student becomes an evangelist for life."

### For Beta Testers & Early Adopters

**Exclusive Insider Access:**
> "As a beta user, you're not just testing features—you're deciding which features exist. Vote on the roadmap and your input carries exponential weight since the community is still small. You're literally shaping DormWay's DNA."

**Recognition System (Future Enhancement):**
> "Top voters get recognized in changelogs. Feature submitters get credit when we ship their idea. This isn't anonymous feedback—it's collaborative product development with public recognition."

## Technical Excellence

### Why We Built It In-House

**❌ Canny.io Alternative (what we didn't choose):**
- Cost: $50-400/month recurring
- External dependency
- Limited customization
- Data lives on their servers
- Generic UI that doesn't match our brand
- Can't integrate deeply with our workflows

**✅ Native DormWay System (what we built):**
- Cost: $0 recurring (one-time development)
- Full control over features and UX
- Real-time updates via Ably (<100ms latency)
- Data in our PostgreSQL database
- Seamless Clerk authentication (no separate login)
- Direct Linear integration (auto-creates issues)
- RLS security policies (enterprise-grade)
- Customizable for DormWay-specific use cases

### Technical Highlights Students Care About

**Real-Time Everything:**
"Vote on your laptop, see the count update on your phone instantly. No refresh needed. No delays. Ably pub/sub makes votes feel live, like a group chat."

**Security & Privacy:**
"Row-Level Security (RLS) policies ensure you only see your own votes in the database. Your voting history is private. Public vote counts, private voter identity."

**Graceful Degradation:**
"If Ably goes down, voting still works—you just won't see real-time updates until it's back. We never block core functionality for optional features."

**Mobile-First Design:**
"Built in Next.js with responsive design. Vote on your phone between classes, submit feature requests from your laptop at the library, check roadmap on your iPad."

## Student Empowerment Narratives

### Story 1: The Feature That Almost Didn't Happen

**Scenario:**
A sophomore at Michigan submits: "Add grade calculator to track GPA across semesters."

**Old Way (No Voting System):**
- Submits via support chat
- Gets "we'll consider it" response
- Never hears back
- Feature never built (too low on internal priority list)

**New Way (With Voting):**
- Submits feature request at `/feedback/submit-feature`
- Shares link in GroupMe with 50 friends
- Request gets 73 votes in 48 hours
- Auto-creates Linear issue (DORM-XXX: Grade calculator)
- Team reviews, adds to Q1 2026 roadmap
- Ships 6 weeks later
- All 73 voters get notification: "Your requested feature is live!"
- Sophomore becomes campus DormWay evangelist

**Result:** Student voice → Actual feature. Not a token gesture—a genuine product development loop.

### Story 2: Transparency Wins Trust

**Scenario:**
100 students vote for "Add housing marketplace (Craigslist for dorms)"

**Old Way:**
- Company silently decides not to build (legal liability, moderation costs)
- Students wonder why their feedback was ignored
- Trust erodes

**New Way:**
- Team posts public update on feature request:
  > "We love this idea, and 100 votes shows real demand. However, marketplace features require legal review, moderation infrastructure, and liability insurance we're not equipped for yet. We're tabling this for 2026 H2 when we have the resources to do it right. Thanks for the feedback—this helped us understand what you want, even if we can't deliver it today."
- Students appreciate honesty
- Trust increases

**Result:** Transparency > Empty promises. Students respect real constraints explained openly.

### Story 3: Small Feature, Big Impact

**Scenario:**
Only 8 students vote for "Add dark mode toggle on schedule page"

**Old Way:**
- Too few votes, gets ignored
- Those 8 students (night owls with eye strain) keep struggling

**New Way:**
- Team notices this is low-effort, high-impact
- Ships in 2 days despite low vote count
- Posts update: "Low votes, but we heard you—dark mode is live!"
- Those 8 students feel seen and valued
- They tell friends: "DormWay actually listens, even to small groups"

**Result:** Not everything is a popularity contest. We balance votes with effort/impact analysis.

Hey [Name],

Quick question: When was the last time an app asked *you* what to build?

Not a survey. Not a focus group. Actually giving you the power to decide.

Starting today, you can:
✅ Vote on upcoming DormWay features
✅ Submit your own ideas
✅ Track what's being built in real-time

Here's how it works:
1. Check the roadmap → dormway.app/roadmap
2. See what we're building (Now, Next, Later)
3. Click ⬆️ on features you want most
4. Submit ideas we're missing

**The rule is simple: If enough students vote for it, we build it.**

No corporate politics. No "we'll consider it." Just democracy.

Your votes = Our roadmap.

## Press Kit Excerpt

### Headline
**DormWay Launches Student-Driven Roadmap Voting: "Your Votes = Our Roadmap"**

### Subhead
Student productivity app gives users direct control over product development through real-time voting system built in-house

### Key Quote (Founder/CEO)
> "EdTech companies love to say they 'listen to students,' but very few actually give students decision-making power. With roadmap voting, we're putting students in the driver's seat. If 50 students vote for a feature, that's a mandate—not a suggestion. This is what 'by students, for students' actually looks like."

### Boilerplate
DormWay is a context-aware student intelligence platform designed by students, for students. Unlike traditional productivity tools built by corporate product teams, DormWay's roadmap is shaped directly by its student community through a native voting and feature request system. Students can vote on upcoming features, submit their own ideas, and receive notifications when their requested features ship—creating unprecedented alignment between user needs and product development.

## Integration Points

### Onboarding Flow
**Step 4 (after initial setup):**
> "One last thing: You get to decide what we build next. Check out the roadmap and vote on features you want most. [View Roadmap] [Skip for now]"

### In-App Navigation
- **Main Nav:** "Roadmap" link (purple dot if new features added this week)
- **Feedback Link:** Persistent footer or sidebar

## Competitive Advantage

### What Students Can't Get Elsewhere

1. **Real-Time Voting:** Most tools batch updates. Ours is instant via Ably.
2. **Seamless Auth:** No separate login for feedback platform (Clerk SSO).
3. **Direct Impact:** 25 votes = Linear issue auto-created. No ambiguity.
4. **Full Transparency:** Public roadmap shows exactly what's shipping when.
5. **Student Recognition:** Voters and submitters get credited when features ship.

### Cost Savings for DormWay
- **Canny.io Growth Plan:** $200/month = $2,400/year
- **Native Solution:** $0/month after development
- **3-Year Savings:** $7,200+ (plus no vendor lock-in)

### Strategic Value
- **Differentiation:** Competitors can't easily copy (requires technical investment)
- **Community Building:** Creates engaged, invested user base
- **Product-Market Fit:** Guarantees we build what students actually want
- **Marketing Content:** Voted features become launch announcements with built-in audience

## FAQ for Students

**Q: Does every feature with 25 votes get built?**
A: Not automatically, but it gets reviewed by our team and added to the backlog. We consider: technical feasibility, alignment with vision, effort required, and cross-platform impact. But 25 votes is a strong signal we take seriously.

**Q: Can I vote on multiple features?**
A: Yes! Vote on as many as you want. Your votes help us prioritize.

**Q: What if my feature idea is a duplicate?**
A: Search before submitting! If it exists, upvote it instead. Consolidating votes makes features more likely to ship.

**Q: How do I know if my voted feature shipped?**
A: We'll notify you via email and in-app notification. You can also check the Changelog.

**Q: Can I change my vote?**
A: Yes, click the button again to remove your vote. Vote freely!

**Q: Do votes from freshmen count the same as seniors?**
A: Yep. One student = one vote, regardless of year, campus, or account age.

**Q: What if I submit a feature and it gets zero votes?**
A: That's valuable data too! It tells us the idea doesn't resonate broadly (though we might still build it if it's low-effort and we see strategic value).

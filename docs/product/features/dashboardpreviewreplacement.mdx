# Dashboard Preview Replacement Strategy

## Current Problem
- Desktop card doesn't match mobile-first student experience
- Looks generic, not authentic
- Doesn't feel "live" despite the label
- Doesn't reinforce the "See everything in one place" message

## Solution: Phone-Based Preview

Replace the desktop dashboard card with a phone mockup showing:
1. **Real mobile screenshots** of DormWay in action
2. **Phone frame** that looks authentic
3. **Smooth transitions** between different views (Do Now, Up Next, Due Soon)
4. **Subtle animations** to feel alive

## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Screenshot Carousel (Recommended for MVP)
- Phone frame component
- 3-5 high-quality screenshots
- Auto-rotate every 3-4 seconds
- Smooth fade transitions
- Shows: Do Now view, Up Next view, Due Soon view, Ace interaction

### Option 2: Video (Best for engagement)
- Phone frame with embedded video
- 15-30 second loop
- Shows real student interactions
- Auto-play, muted, looped

### Option 3: Interactive Demo (Future)
- Actual interactive component
- Read-only demo mode
- Users can explore

## Recommended: Screenshot Carousel

**Why:**
- Fast to implement
- Shows real app
- Works everywhere
- Easy to update
- Can upgrade to video later

**What to show:**
1. Do Now view - showing urgent assignments
2. Up Next view - showing upcoming work
3. Due Soon view - showing all deadlines
4. Ace interaction - showing personalized help
5. Course overview - showing "everything in one place"

**Design:**
- iPhone-style frame (most recognizable)
- Subtle glow/shadow
- Smooth fade transitions
- Auto-rotate with pause on hover
- Responsive sizing

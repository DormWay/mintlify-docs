#### Email 1.3: Permission Primer
```html
Subject: Quick question about notifications, {{first_name}}
Preview: Customize how DormWay keeps you informed
From: Sarah Chen <sarah@dormway.app>

Hey {{first_name}},

Sarah here from DormWay! I wanted to reach out personally about notifications.

I know notification overload is real (I'm a recent grad myself!), so we built DormWay differently:

🔕 Quiet hours: No notifications during sleep/study time
📊 Smart batching: Groups related reminders
🎯 Only what matters: Deadlines, classes, and what YOU choose
⚙️ Full control: Change settings anytime

Here's what students tell us helps most:
• Morning briefing (8 AM): "Today's classes and deadlines"
• Smart reminders: "Assignment due in 24 hours"
• Class alerts: "Calc 2 in 30 min at Mason Hall"

[Customize My Notifications] <- Primary CTA

Or keep them off – DormWay works great either way! You can always check the app for updates.

BTW, we NEVER send:
❌ Marketing messages as notifications
❌ Social updates or spam
❌ Anything during your quiet hours

Questions? Hit reply – I personally read every email!

Best,
Sarah Chen
Student Success @ DormWay
University of Michigan '23

P.S. You can change these settings anytime in the app. We're all about flexibility!

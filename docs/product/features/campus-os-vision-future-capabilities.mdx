# Campus OS Vision (Future Capabilities)

This document captures the forward-looking product vision for DormWay as the Operating System for campus life. It is not a Source of Truth and does not describe current implementation. Use it to guide discovery, prioritization, and roadmap planning.

## Pivot Point

DormWay cannot be only a better calendar. It must become the Operating System for campus life. The largest opportunity is contextual intelligence: the app should morph based on student context instead of showing the same UI all day.

## Vocabulary and Positioning

- Dashboard Stack: finite, user-controlled, completion-friendly.
- Heads Up: thin, time-sensitive signal layer (not a feed).
- Presence: passive social signals and body doubling, not posts.
- Headless LMS: Canvas data without Canvas UI.

Use the words "dashboard" or "stack" in student-facing copy for core productivity views. Reserve "feed" for internal pipelines only.

## Experience Principles

- Control over consumption: finite states reduce anxiety.
- Capture in under 3 seconds: if it takes longer, students leave.
- Invisible AI: AI should organize and reduce work, not demand attention.
- Trust layer first: freshness, sources, and correctness are non-negotiable.

## 1) Morphing Dashboard (Context-Aware UI)

The home experience changes based on "student state."

### Morning Dash Mode (7 AM - 9 AM)
- Visual: high contrast, large text, glanceable.
- Content: weather, time-to-leave, first class location, quick coffee action.
- Interaction: one-tap "I'm awake" to clear morning alarms and sync the day.

### Focus Mode (During Class or Study Blocks)
- Visual: minimal, dark mode, low noise.
- Content: current task and lecture notes only.
- Interaction: camera capture button prominent for whiteboard snaps.

### Night Owl Mode (8 PM - 2 AM)
- Visual: softer colors, reduced blue light.
- Content: social heatmaps, food delivery, safe-walk shortcuts.

## 2) Camera-First Input (Gen Z Standard)

- Syllabus Scanner: photo -> AI -> dates and readings -> calendar + tasks.
- Whiteboard Ghost: snap -> auto-crop -> file as course lecture notes based on time.
- Event Flyer Grabber: snap -> parse date/time -> prompt add to calendar.

## 3) Hyper-Local Integrations (Sticky Daily Use)

- Laundry Live Activity: lock screen countdown and "done" notifications.
- Dining Vibe Check: menus + crowd signals, favorite food alerts.
- Safe Walk: walking home mode with "I'm safe" confirmation and auto-alerts.

## 4) Passive Social (Body Doubling)

- Library Widget: avatars + green dots for friends studying now.
- "Nudge" and "Join" actions that jump to existing channels.
- "Who's free for lunch" toggle to reduce coordination friction.

## 5) One-Tap Micro-Interactions

- Running Late: one tap to notify meeting organizer.
- Grade Calculator Slider: quick outcome preview per course.
- Brain Dump Audio: hold to record, AI turns it into a task.

## 6) DormWay Wallet (Long-Term)

- Apple Wallet student ID and dining dollars.
- Roommate split and IOU tracker with Venmo deep-links.

## 7) Digital-First OS (Headless LMS)

DormWay should become the skin for Canvas. Students should never need to open the Canvas app.

### Non-Negotiables (Trust Layer)

- Spoiler-Free Grades: "graded" card -> reveal animation and private score.
- Deep Link Triage: every assignment card has a direct submit link.
- Sync Pulse: visible freshness indicator ("Synced 1m ago").

## 8) Contextual Intelligence Innovations

- Smart Deferral (Task Tetris): swipe task -> schedule a work block automatically.
- Lecture Context Mode: during class, surface Zoom/link, notes, and last assignment.
- Classmate Radar: show who else is in the course without exposing content.

## 9) Quick Wins (Make It Feel Magical)

- Canvas Clean-Up: sanitize messy assignment names via Ace.
- Break Detection: auto-insert 15-minute brain breaks after long blocks.
- Walking Time Buffers: insert travel blocks between buildings.

## 10) Execution and Optimization

### Smart Deferral (Task Tetris)
- Swipe right on a task -> choose "now," "tomorrow morning," or "before due date."
- System scans free blocks and drops a work block.

### Ace as a Context Menu
- Replace chatbot-first with context actions on assignments.
- Example actions: "How long will this take?" "Am I cooked?" "Quiz me."

### Locked In Mode
- True black, one task, timer ring, Live Activity on lock screen.
- "Add 5 minutes" action without unlock.

## 11) Social Roster (Privacy-First)

- Course detail shows "Class Pulse" (how many classmates use DormWay).
- Opt-in "Looking for study group" signals to other opt-in users.
- Offer a "Drop Link" to existing chat channels instead of native chat.

## 12) Academic Weapons (Utility Features)

- Global syllabus search (policies, grading, deadlines).
- Packer: daily reminder for required items based on schedule.
- Walking time visualization in schedule view.

## 13) Launch Readiness Checklist (Student Perspective)

| Surface | Must Have (Non-Negotiable) | Wow Factor (Innovation) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Onboarding | One-tap Canvas connect | "We found 5 classes and 12 assignments" |
| Today | Dashboard stack + Heads Up | Spoiler-free grade cards |
| Tasks | Deep links to submit | Smart Deferral (Swipe to Schedule) |
| Schedule | Accurate time/location | Walking time buffers |
| Library | Auto-folders per course | "Search my syllabus" |

## 14) Build Order (Proposed)

1) Smart Deferral (Task -> Time Block)
2) Ace context menu actions
3) Locked In mode + Live Activity
4) Presence widget (body doubling)
5) Hyper-local integrations (Laundry, Dining)

## Documentation Lifecycle

DormWay documentation follows a standard lifecycle across sections. Understanding this flow helps you navigate the vault and know where to look for information at each stage:

```
Problem/Opportunity
       ↓
[Analysis](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)     ← Research, gap analysis, feasibility
       ↓
[Workplan](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)     ← Choose approach, sequence work
       ↓
[Features](/docs/product/features/readme)     ← Define spec, user stories
       ↓
[Architecture](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)  ← Record structural decisions (if large)
       ↓
[Technical](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)   ← Implementation details, patterns
       ↓
[Memory](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)         ← Session notes showing how we got there
```

**Best Practice**: Link docs bidirectionally as you move through the flow. For example:
- Link feature spec → architecture decisions
- Link workplan → feature spec → analysis
- Link session notes → all relevant docs touched

This creates a narrative thread showing how ideas evolved into implementation.

# Student Life Surfaces - Widgets and HeadsUp Spec (Draft)

## Purpose
Define the student-first information hierarchy and interaction model for DormWay widgets across web and iOS. This is a temporary top-to-bottom spec to align what exists, what it shows, and how it behaves without overwhelming students.

## Alignment (existing research and strategy)
- [Dashboard v2 & Widget Strategy (Current)](/docs/engineering/architecture/dashboard-v2-widget-strategy-current) for current Home V2 implementation and widget contract.
- Home V2 Batch-First Widgets (Long-Term Spec) for the default widget set and progressive disclosure model.
- [Home_V2_Widget_Command_Center_Analysis](/docs/research/homev2widgetcommandcenteranalysis) for reactive vs proactive gaps and command center scope.
- WIDGET_DATA_FORMATS for student reality insights and beta priority widgets.

## Goals
- Make the dashboard a complete, low-friction home for student life (courses, schedule, tasks, heads up).
- Maximize useful information density while keeping scanning effortless.
- Use progressive disclosure so details are available but never forced on screen.
- Minimize navigation away from the dashboard; prefer in-place expansion and side panels.

## Non-goals
- Final visual design tokens or layout measurements.
- Implementation details of backend data pipelines.

## Definitions
- Widget: A persistent dashboard module with a stable footprint and a scrollable interior.
- Feed card: A time-sensitive item rendered inside the HeadsUp widget.
- HeadsUp: The feed widget that surfaces prioritized cards from multiple domains.
- Progressive disclosure: Reveal more detail through expand, hover, or panel, without full navigation.

## Experience Principles
- Scan in 5 seconds: primary info must be visible without interaction.
- Expand in place: the default "more" behavior is scroll/expand inside the widget.
- One primary action: every widget/card has a clear next step.
- Details without detours: use drawers/sheets before full-page navigation.
- No dead states: empty, loading, and error are always informative and actionable.
- Reactive plus proactive: show "what is due" and "what will become a problem soon."
- Stable defaults: keep the default widget set small and consistent.

## Progressive Disclosure Contract (All Surfaces)
Level 0: Glance
- Smallest widget size shows the minimum viable info.

Level 1: In-widget expand (default "view more")
- Scroll inside the widget; no layout shift or context loss.

Level 2: Detail panel (preferred over full navigation)
- Right-side drawer on web, bottom sheet on mobile.
- Shows rich details + actions while staying on dashboard.

Level 3: Full page
- Only when the user explicitly chooses "Open full view."

## Student Life OS Hierarchy (What Exists, What It Shows, How It Shows It)

### Level 0: Right Now Command Center (always-on)
Students should be able to answer: what is next, what is due, what am I missing, what is at risk.

0.1 Today Timeline (Schedule)
- Needs: next class/event, where to be, when to leave, day at a glance.
- Outputs: "Next up" with time/location, mini timeline, conflict and late warnings.
- Surface: Schedule widget (glance + scroll) with HeadsUp cards for disruptions.

0.2 What is Due / What is Blocking
- Needs: top priority assignments, due today/tomorrow, accurate overdue.
- Outputs: next due item, due window, overdue vs submitted, quick actions.
- Surface: Tasks widget (glance + list) and HeadsUp for due changes.

0.3 Course Reality (risk and context)
- Needs: which course is risky, what is coming up, quick LMS jump.
- Outputs: course list with due count and risk badge, course detail panel.
- Surface: Courses widget and course detail panel (drawer/sheet).

0.4 HeadsUp Feed (prioritized interrupts)
- Needs: one place for important items from everywhere, not spammy.
- Outputs: top 1-2 cards at glance, scrollable feed, "why shown," dismiss/snooze.
- Surface: HeadsUp widget only (feed cards are not separate widgets).

### Level 1: Academic Core (daily/weekly)

1.1 Assignments and Submissions
- Needs: assignment status, submission state, rubrics, late policy.
- Outputs: assignment detail with checklist, status states, submit link.
- Surface: detail panels first, full page optional.

1.2 Study Planning and Work Sessions
- Needs: break big tasks, time-block suggestions, focus sessions (optional).
- Outputs: suggested work blocks, "if you have 45 minutes do X."
- Surface: panel module, optional future widget.

1.3 Notes, Files, and Class Materials
- Needs: recent notes, slides, syllabus, search across class materials.
- Outputs: most recent files per course, "open this week" link.
- Surface: course detail panel sections, dedicated materials page later.

1.4 Announcements and Messaging
- Needs: important announcements without LMS noise.
- Outputs: important announcement cards, response required flags.
- Surface: HeadsUp cards and course panel sections.

1.5 Grades and Performance (sensitive)
- Needs: current grade, impact of next exam, risk signals.
- Outputs: trend and action nudges, not anxiety-driven alerts.
- Surface: panels and optional HeadsUp nudges, opt-in early.

### Level 2: Life Logistics (situational)
Only surface when relevant or pinned. Default to HeadsUp, not core widgets.

2.1 Campus Logistics (dining, transit, events)
- Surface: HeadsUp cards for schedule-impacting items, separate page later.

2.2 Housing and Roommate Life
- Surface: separate Home or Living area, occasional HeadsUp reminders.

2.3 Social and Clubs
- Surface: schedule integration and optional communities page.

2.4 Work and Career
- Surface: schedule, tasks, and HeadsUp for deadlines.

2.5 Money
- Surface: separate Money section with HeadsUp for due dates.

2.6 Health and Wellness
- Surface: opt-in section, minimal HeadsUp only if enabled.

### Level 3: Admin and Systems (monthly/semester)
3.1 Registration and Degree Progress
- Surface: dedicated pages, occasional HeadsUp for holds and deadlines.

3.2 University Bureaucracy (forms, holds)
- Surface: HeadsUp cards plus admin page.

3.3 Identity and Access (sync health)
- Surface: HeadsUp for sync failures, settings for details.

## System Hierarchy Summary (default beta)
Home dashboard should ship with a strict default set:
1) Today
2) Schedule
3) Tasks
4) Courses
5) HeadsUp

Inspector surfaces to ship alongside:
- Course detail inspector
- Assignment detail inspector
- Task detail inspector
- Full schedule page (optional)
- All tasks page (canonical)

### Tasks Page (Canonical Full View)
- Scope: every actionable task (personal + academic) in one list.
- Data precedence: Tasks V2 is authoritative; deliverables fill gaps so nothing is missed.
- Sections: Overdue, Due Soon (today + next 7 days), Later/Backlog.
- Interaction: search-first, filters secondary; deep link from Today/Courses.

## HeadsUp Governance (beta)
Allowed categories:
- Academic urgency (due soon, overdue, due date changed)
- Schedule disruptions (canceled, room change, conflict)
- System and sync issues (data stale, reconnect Canvas)

Gated categories:
- Campus logistics only if it impacts schedule (transit delay, closure).

Rules:
- Glance shows 1-2 cards max.
- Feed is scrollable but capped; do not show 40 cards.
- Every card has: reason shown, primary CTA, dismiss/snooze with undo.
- Cards that interrupt focus must be high confidence and time sensitive.

## Widget Interaction Standards
- A single "View all" control per widget. No duplicate "more" toggles.
- Default click opens the inspector (no layout shift).
- Pin moves the current inspector item into a small dock (max 3).
- Dock is an overlay tray and never shrinks the dashboard; it may auto-collapse on small screens.
- "View all" always opens the full list inside the inspector (never a new page).
- Entire card rows are clickable; hover reveals quick actions.
- Scrolling inside a widget is always enabled if list exceeds space.
- Dismissals are reversible for HeadsUp cards (undo).

## Schedule Widget Interaction Contract (web)
- Click or drag on an empty slot opens a quick-add popover anchored to the slot.
- Quick add includes: start time nudges (+/-15), duration presets, event type toggle, and optional auto-title.
- Conflicts are surfaced in the popover (no blocking, warn only).
- "Details" opens the full event form panel anchored near the slot.
- Editable events support updating title, time range, type, location, and notes.
- Event click opens the class/event detail popover; edit/delete are available for editable events only.

## HeadsUp Feed Card Taxonomy (baseline)
The HeadsUp widget is a multi-domain feed. Categories should be explicit:
- Academic urgency: new assignments, overdue, due date changes.
- Class logistics: room changes, class canceled, time shift.
- Schedule conflicts: overlapping events or travel time risk.
- Campus logistics: dining hours, transit delays, event reminders.
- Progress nudges: streak break risk, study session suggestion.
- System and onboarding: sync issues, data refresh needed.

## Course Detail Inspector (Courses)
Minimum fields:
- Course code + title, instructor, meeting time(s), location.
- Upcoming assignments (top 3), announcements (top 2).
- Quick links: LMS, syllabus, office hours, grade view.
- Status flags: overdue, attendance risk, high workload week.
Notes:
- Canvas base URL must be campus-specific (do not hardcode instructure.com).

## Density and Size Behavior
- 1x1/1x2: show 2-3 items max; focus on the next actionable item.
- 2x2: show 4-6 items with one key metadata line each.
- 2x3/3x3: allow expanded list, quick actions row, and insights.

## Cross-Platform Mapping
- Web: inspector opens as right-side overlay (no layout shift); dock is always an overlay tray.
- iOS: inspector opens as bottom sheet; long-press reveals actions.
- Visual design should remain consistent, but interaction patterns follow platform norms.

## States
- Loading: skeleton cards matching final layout.
- Empty: short guidance + primary action (e.g., "Connect Canvas", "Add course").
- Error: explain issue and offer retry.

## Success Criteria
- Students can identify next class, top task, and highest priority HeadsUp in under 10 seconds.
- Majority of detail exploration happens via Level 1 or 2, not full-page navigation.
- Users can access all course info without leaving the dashboard.
- HeadsUp dismissal rate stays below the spam threshold (monitor).

## Open Questions (to resolve)
- Which HeadsUp card types are allowed to interrupt focus (pin or highlight)?
- What is the minimum set of course metadata across campuses?
- How should schedule conflicts be displayed on very small widgets?
- How to surface proactive warnings without creating anxiety?

## Student Life OS Hierarchy and IA Map

### Naming and Scope Lock
To prevent drift:

- Widget name: Schedule
- Concept name: Today Timeline (a view inside Schedule)
- Home V2 canonical widgets (beta): Today, Courses, Schedule, Tasks, HeadsUp (and only these)

Optional/secondary surfaces (Campus logistics, Study/Focus, Notes/Files, Grades/Insights, Money, Work/Career, Wellness, Admin) do not become Home widgets unless explicitly added to the Widget Contract. They appear as:

- HeadsUp cards (when relevant)
- Detail panel sections
- Dedicated pages/tabs

## Interaction Contract by Level
This is the universal rule set across web + iOS.

### Level 0: Right Now (Dashboard default)
Goal: answer What is next? What is due? What is risky? in under 10 seconds.

- Default interaction: in-widget scroll (no layout shifts)
- Secondary: quick actions (mark done, dismiss/snooze, open panel)
- Navigation: avoid full page unless explicitly chosen

### Level 1: Academic Core
Goal: manage assignments, details, materials, performance.

- Default interaction: inspector overlay (right-side on web, bottom sheet on iOS)
- Navigation: full page only for "Open full view"

### Level 2: Life Logistics
Goal: campus, housing, work, money, social surfaced when relevant.

- Default interaction: panels and cards
- Navigation: full page for deeper workflows

### Level 3: Admin + Systems
Goal: registration, holds, accommodations, account health.

- Default interaction: dedicated pages
- HeadsUp only for urgent "action required" or "sync broken"

## Universal Inspector + Pin Dock Contract
The inspector is the default detail surface. Pinning is optional and bounded.

Inspector (default):
- Single persistent overlay that does not reflow the dashboard.
- Click any item (course/task/schedule/HeadsUp) -> inspector updates to the latest selection.
- Escape closes; clicking another item replaces contents.
- Non-modal by default; dashboard remains interactive.
- Content is short-then-deep: summary first, details scroll below.

Pin (optional, power use):
- Pin converts the current inspector item into a docked card.
- Max pinned items: 3 (replace oldest or prompt to replace).
- Pinned cards collapse by default to reduce clutter.
- Clear all available in the dock header.
- Pin should feel rare and intentional, not required.

Dock (workspace, not a second layout):
- Dock is an overlay tray anchored to the right; it never reserves layout width.
- Dock never shrinks the dashboard (even on wide screens).
- Dock auto-collapses when idle unless pinned items exist.
- Dock never becomes a window manager; no freeform dragging in v1.

View all:
- Only appears when a widget is capped for size or performance.
- Opens a full list inside the inspector (not a new page).

Mobile rules:
- Click opens the inspector as a bottom sheet.
- Pin adds to a lightweight Pinned list (no persistent dock).
- View all opens the full list inside the inspector sheet.

Inspector layout (always consistent):
- Header: title + type chip + pin + close.
- Summary row: 1-2 lines max.
- Primary actions: one main CTA + 1-2 secondary.
- Scrollable details: lists and extended info live here.

## Overlay Interaction + Accessibility Rules
These rules prevent overlay chaos and ensure predictable behavior.

Interaction rules:
- Clicking outside does not close the inspector by default (close via X or Esc).
- Clicking a new item replaces inspector contents (selection moves).
- Inspector scroll resets on new selection (no stale scroll position).

Focus rules:
- On open, focus moves to the inspector container.
- On selection replace, keep focus if already inside the inspector.
- Esc closes inspector and restores focus to the previously focused item.
- Focus ring is always visible on inspector actions.

Selection state:
- The currently selected item is highlighted in the originating widget.
- Only one "current selection" exists at a time.

## Pinned Item Identity + Dedupe Rules
Pinned items must be deterministic and non-duplicative.

Rules:
- Do not allow duplicate pins of the same entity.
- Different entity kinds may coexist (course + assignment + task).
- If a pinned entity disappears (course removed, assignment deleted), show a minimal "no longer available" state with remove action.

IDs:
- Course pin key: courseContextId (fallback to course id).
- Assignment pin key: assignment id + courseContextId when available.
- Task pin key: task id.
- Schedule pin key: event id + start time.
- HeadsUp pin key: card id.

## Interrupt Semantics (single behavior definition)
Interrupt = pin to top of HeadsUp, show a badge, and apply a subtle pulse animation once (no push notification by default).

## Freshness UX Copy + Placement
Keep language calm and action-oriented.

Copy:
- Banner/Chip: "Data may be out of date"
- CTA: "Reconnect Canvas" or "Refresh data"

Placement:
- Today widget: small chip near context row when stale.
- Courses/Tasks/Schedule: inline chip in header when stale.
- HeadsUp: system health card when stale thresholds exceeded.

## HeadsUp Governance (No Junk Drawer)
HeadsUp is not a feed of everything. It is a small set of prioritized interrupts.

### Allowed Categories (Beta)
Must-have:
- Academic urgency (due soon, overdue, changed due date, submission issues)
- Schedule disruptions (cancelled, room change, conflict, travel risk)
- System health (sync issues, stale data, permission problems)

Allowed only if directly impacts today:
- Campus logistics (transit delay affects ETA; dining closure affects plan only if opted in)

Not in beta:
- Generic insights, streak nudges, wellness, marketing, random campus events

### Card Caps (Hard Limits)
- Glance: show 1-2 cards max
- Expanded feed: show max 10 cards visible (scroll for more only if explicitly requested)
- Per-category caps in expanded view:
  - Academic urgency: max 5
  - Schedule disruptions: max 3
  - System health: max 2
  - Campus logistics: max 1 (only if impacts today)
- Interrupt rules (highlight/pin):
  - Only system health and schedule disruption can interrupt
  - Academic urgency can be highlighted only if due under 6 hours or overdue

### Required Fields for Every HeadsUp Card
- Title (short)
- Why shown (one line, plain language)
- Primary CTA (one)
- Secondary: dismiss/snooze (where allowed) + undo/snackbar

## Data Sources and Freshness Requirements
This prevents stale data from looking correct.

Freshness standard:
- Schedule / next event: must be fresh within 5 minutes
- Assignments / due dates: must be fresh within 15 minutes (or on user refresh)
- System health: real-time or near real-time (<= 2 minutes)
- Campus logistics: timestamped and shown only if within valid term/date window

If data is stale beyond the threshold, surface a system health HeadsUp card ("DormWay data needs refresh") rather than showing misleading info.

## Information Architecture Map

### Level 0: Dashboard (Home V2)

| Surface | Primary Questions Answered | Default View | Expand Behavior | Data Source | Freshness | Triggers / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schedule (Today Timeline) | What is next? Where? When leave? Conflicts? | Next up + mini timeline | In-widget scroll -> Inspector | Batch schedule payload | <=5 min | Conflicts/room change become HeadsUp |
| Tasks | What is due next? What is due today? | Due today count + next item | Scroll list -> Inspector | Batch tasks payload + user tasks | <=15 min | Due soon/overdue can create HeadsUp |
| Courses | Which class is risky? What is coming? | List + next class + due count/risk badge | Scroll -> Inspector | Batch courses payload + LMS metadata | <=15 min | Risk must be actionable, not scary |
| HeadsUp | What needs attention now? | Top 1-2 cards | Scroll feed -> Inspector | Aggregated feed (batch-first) | <=5-15 min | Governance + caps apply |

### Level 1: Academic Core (Panels/Pages)

| Surface | What Students Need | Default | Where It Lives | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Course detail inspector | Upcoming assignments, announcements, links, status | Inspector overlay | From Courses widget rows | All course info without leaving dashboard |
| Assignment detail | Requirements, checklist, submission state | Inspector overlay | From Tasks or Course inspector | Submitted vs not must be clear |
| Task detail | Priority, due, course, notes | Inspector overlay | From Tasks widget | Quick actions always available |
| Materials | Recent files, syllabus, readings | Course inspector section | Course inspector | Search later |
| Performance / Grades (opt-in early) | Trend, risk, what to do next | Inspector/page | Course inspector | Avoid over-notifying |

### Level 2: Life Logistics (Cards first, pages later)

| Domain | What They Need | How It Surfaces (Beta) | Later Expansion |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Campus logistics | Dining, transit, events | HeadsUp only if impacts today | Dedicated tab/page |
| Work/Career | Shifts, deadlines | Schedule + Tasks + HeadsUp | Career hub |
| Money | Bills, tuition | HeadsUp for deadlines | Money hub |
| Housing | Chores, maintenance | Tasks + shared lists | Home/Living hub |
| Social/clubs | Meetings, plans | Schedule integration | Communities hub |
| Wellness (opt-in) | Appointments | Schedule + minimal reminders | Wellness hub |

### Level 3: Admin + Systems

| Domain | What They Need | Surface | Trigger |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Registration/degree progress | Deadlines, holds | Page | HeadsUp only if action required |
| Sync health | Connect/reconnect | HeadsUp + settings | Always allowed to interrupt |
| Policies/forms | Petitions/accommodations | Page | HeadsUp only if deadlines |

## Success Metrics
Track these to validate "dense but calm":

- Time to answer: next class + top task + top HeadsUp (under 10 seconds)
- Percent of detail opens via panel vs full page (target over 70 percent panel)
- HeadsUp dismissal rate + snooze usage (detect spam)
- Rate of stale data warnings (should decrease over time)
- Layout persistence success rate (Home V2 saves)

## Phased Plan (Now -> End Goal)
This plan turns the hierarchy and IA map into a build sequence that keeps scope controlled while improving the day-to-day student experience.
These phases describe target behavior; completion is tracked separately. Do not assume implemented unless explicitly noted in Engineering SoT with code references.

### Phase 0: Decision Lock (1-2 days)
Objective: remove ambiguity so spec and implementation match.

Decisions:
- Keep Today widget as the ambient context base widget.
- Home V2 default set stays: Today, Schedule, Tasks, Courses, HeadsUp.
- Courses widget uses single "View all" and scroll-in-widget as default.

Deliverables (define):
- Update this spec if any defaults change.
- Confirm that default widget list matches registry and SoT.

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- Spec and implementation default set aligned.
  - Owner: Product
  - Proof: SoT and registry list the same defaults.

### Phase 1: Courses Widget Fix (1-2 weeks)
Objective: remove the most visible UX break and align progressive disclosure.

Scope:
- One "View all" control.
- Scroll inside widget always enabled for overflow.
- Row click opens course inspector (overlay, no layout shift).
- Remove secondary glassmorphic view and duplicate toggle.

Phase 1 Sub-Checklist:
- [ ] Courses widget: single "View all" behavior confirmed across sizes.
- [ ] Inspector v1 behavior: non-modal, short-then-deep, close via X/Esc.
- [ ] Active inspector selection highlights the originating widget row/card.
- [ ] Inspector content: minimum course fields (code/title, next class, top assignments, announcements, Canvas link).
- [ ] Pin button present in inspector header (dock behind flag if needed).
- [ ] Mobile rules: inspector = bottom sheet; pin = pinned list (no dock).

Deliverables (implement):
- Courses widget UX updated across Home V2 sizes.
- Course inspector with minimum required fields (code, title, next class, due, announcements, links).

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- No duplicate "more" behaviors.
  - Owner: Engineering
  - Proof: Manual QA shows only one "View all" control.
- Scroll works in 2x2 and 2x3 sizes.
  - Owner: Engineering
  - Proof: Short screen capture in both sizes.

### Phase 2: HeadsUp Governance v1 (1-2 weeks)
Objective: reduce feed noise and enforce the "interrupt rules."

Scope:
- Lock beta categories (academic urgency, schedule disruptions, system health).
- Enforce caps: glance 1-2, expanded max 10 with per-category limits.
- Ensure "why shown" is displayed for each card.
- Dismiss/snooze with undo.

Deliverables (implement):
- HeadsUp UI aligns with governance rules.
- Cards show "why shown" and consistent CTA structure.

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- HeadSup items never exceed caps.
  - Owner: Engineering
  - Proof: QA checklist + screenshot of expanded feed at cap.
- Users can dismiss/snooze with visible undo.
  - Owner: Engineering
  - Proof: Short screen capture of dismiss + undo.

### Phase 3: Freshness + System Health (1-2 weeks)
Objective: make data trust visible and prevent stale data from masquerading as current.

Scope:
- Add shared freshness fields to widget content: lastSyncedAt, isStale, staleReason.
- HeadsUp system health card when stale thresholds exceeded.
- Subtle stale indicators in Schedule/Tasks/Courses/Today.

Deliverables (implement):
- Widget payloads include freshness metadata (when available).
- System health HeadsUp card with reconnect or refresh CTA.

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- Stale data is surfaced consistently across widgets.
  - Owner: Engineering
  - Proof: QA checklist + screenshots showing stale state.
- System health cards appear when thresholds are exceeded.
  - Owner: Engineering
  - Proof: Simulated stale state screenshot or test harness.

### Phase 4: Academic Core Depth (2-4 weeks)
Objective: deepen the detail panels so users do not need to leave the dashboard.

Scope:
- Assignment detail panel (checklist, submission status, rubric).
- Task detail panel (priority, due, course, notes, quick actions).
- Materials section (recent files, syllabus link, open this week).
- Grades/performance as opt-in surface.

Deliverables (implement):
- Panels implement minimum data requirements from IA map.
- Navigation away is optional, not required.

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- Users can complete core academic flows without leaving the dashboard.
  - Owner: Product + Engineering
  - Proof: Test checklist for assignment and task flows.
- Panel usage >70 percent vs full page.
  - Owner: Product
  - Proof: Analytics report from events.

### Phase 5: Life Logistics Expansion (future)
Objective: expand beyond academics without cluttering the Home surface.

Scope:
- Campus logistics, work/career, money, housing, social, wellness.
- HeadsUp only when directly relevant to the day.
- Dedicated pages or tabs for deeper workflows.

Deliverables (implement when approved):
- Optional modules gated by opt-in and relevance rules.

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- No net increase in Home widget count unless the contract changes.
  - Owner: Product
  - Proof: SoT and registry unchanged or updated with approval.

### Phase 6: OS-Level Maturity (future)
Objective: proactive, cross-domain guidance that feels calm and helpful.

Scope:
- Proactive warnings (deadline traffic jam, conflict risk).
- Smarter suggestions (time blocks, study sessions).
- Consistent confidence signals to prevent false alarms.

Deliverables (implement when approved):
- Proactive cards and panels with clear "why shown" and opt-out.

Exit criteria (owner + proof):
- Proactive alerts improve completion rates without increased dismissals.
  - Owner: Product
  - Proof: Analytics comparison before/after rollout.

## Implementation Snapshot (as of 2025-12-24)
verified: not yet (requires manual QA checklist + screenshots)
Use this to track what is implemented vs what still needs work. Update after each meaningful change.

### Continuation Prompt (copy/paste)
```
You are continuing the DormWay Student Life Surfaces spec and Home V2 implementation.
Primary spec: obsidian-vault/DormWay/Product/Features/Dashboard/Student Life Surfaces - Widgets and HeadsUp Spec (Draft).md

What is implemented in code (not fully QAed yet):
- Courses widget uses a single "View all" control and in-widget scroll (no duplicate "more" toggles).
- "View all" opens a course list inside the inspector via navigation entity kind course_list.
- Course rows open the inspector via navigation entity kind course.
- Courses list rendering is capped by layout; "View all" appears when capped.
- Inspector overlay supports course list and course detail (next class from timeline events, top 3 dueSoon assignments, announcements placeholder, Open in Canvas CTA).
- Inspector supports tasks and assignments with mark-complete actions (existing).
- Inspector is non-modal; Esc closes and focus is restored.
- Navigation supports course_list entity kind and inspector URL sync.
- Dock v1 overlay tray is implemented (max 3 pinned, clear all, dedupe).
- Pin toggle now adds/removes items from the dock.
- Courses widget highlights the active inspector selection.

What still needs to be done to match the spec:
- Mobile inspector behavior (bottom sheet) and pinned list (no dock).
- Extend selection highlight to Tasks/Schedule/HeadsUp widgets.
- Course detail enrichment: instructor, meeting time/location source of truth, syllabus, office hours, announcements data.
- HeadsUp governance enforcement (caps, "why shown", interrupt rules).
- Freshness fields + stale UI indicators + system health HeadsUp card.
- QA Courses widget sizes (2x2, 2x3) for scroll, view all, and inspector behavior.
- Remove or repurpose unused CourseDetailPopover if no longer needed.

Key files to review:
- .repos/dormway-platform/services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/home-v2/widgets/CoursesWidget.tsx
- .repos/dormway-platform/services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/home-v2/navigation/InspectorPanel.tsx
- .repos/dormway-platform/services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/home-v2/navigation/NavigationProvider.tsx
- .repos/dormway-platform/services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/home-v2/page.tsx
```

## Risks and Mitigations
- Risk: HeadsUp becomes noisy. Mitigation: strict caps, opt-in, and "why shown."
- Risk: Stale data erodes trust. Mitigation: freshness signals and system health cards.
- Risk: Too many surfaces. Mitigation: enforce the widget contract.
- Risk: Pin feels like work. Mitigation: pin is optional, capped, and collapsed by default.
- Risk: Inspector feels modal. Mitigation: keep it non-blocking and short-then-deep.

## Validation Checklist
- Courses widget: one "View all" control and scroll works.
- HeadsUp: caps enforced and dismiss/snooze visible.
- Freshness: stale data does not appear without warning.
- Panels: detail coverage meets IA map minimums.

## Quick UX Test Plan (5 tasks)
- Find what is next in under 5 seconds.
- Open a course and find the next assignment.
- Keep two contexts open (Course + Task) while scanning schedule.
- Dismiss a HeadsUp card and undo.
- Recover from accidental inspector close (re-open quickly).

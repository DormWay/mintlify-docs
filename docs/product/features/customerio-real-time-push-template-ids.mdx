# Customer.io Real-time Push Template IDs

## Overview
Following the existing pattern (like `morning_briefing_push`, `midday_checkin_push`, etc.), we need to create empty push notification templates in Customer.io with specific IDs for tracking purposes. The actual content is generated by our system and passed directly via the API.

## Required Template IDs

### Location-Based Events
- `realtime_library_arrival_push` - When user arrives at library with assignments
- `realtime_leaving_campus_push` - When user leaves campus with tomorrow's work

### Study Session Events  
- `realtime_study_break_push` - Break reminder after long study session
- `realtime_study_encouragement_push` - Positive reinforcement for productive studying

### Context Change Events
- `realtime_campus_arrival_push` - Welcome to campus with schedule
- `realtime_study_mode_push` - Study mode activation confirmation
- `realtime_campus_departure_push` - Leaving campus reminder

### Academic Events
- `realtime_deadline_urgent_push` - Assignment due within 24 hours
- `realtime_deadline_detected_push` - New deadline found from syllabus

### Schedule Changes
- `realtime_class_cancelled_push` - Class cancellation notification
- `realtime_calendar_sync_push` - New calendar event detected

### Re-engagement
- `realtime_reengagement_push` - Re-engage after missed notifications

### Generic Fallback
- `realtime_generic_push` - Generic real-time notification

## Customer.io Template Setup

For each template ID above:

1. **Create a new Push Campaign** in Customer.io
2. **Campaign Type**: API Triggered Broadcast  
3. **Campaign ID**: Use the exact template ID from above
4. **Template Content**: 
   ```
   Title: {{ title }}
   Body: {{ message }}
   ```
   (The actual content will be overridden by our API call)

5. **Settings**:
   - Enable push notifications
   - No scheduling (immediate delivery)
   - No segmentation (we handle targeting in our system)

## Usage in Code

When sending a real-time notification:

```typescript
// Example from notification activities
await sendCustomerIODirectPush(
  userId,
  {
    title: 'Perfect timing! 📚',
    body: 'You\'re at the library. Ready to make progress on your assignments?',
    data: {
      type: 'study_suggestion',
      location: 'library',
      assignment_id: 'assignment-123',
      deep_link: 'dormway://study/assignment-123'
    }
  },
  'realtime_library_arrival_push' // Template ID for tracking
);
```

## Tracking & Analytics

The template IDs allow us to:
- Track delivery rates per notification type
- Monitor engagement by notification category
- A/B test different real-time triggers
- Analyze which contextual notifications are most effective

## Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Create all templates in Customer.io production
- [ ] Verify template IDs match exactly (case-sensitive)
- [ ] Test each template with a test user
- [ ] Monitor initial delivery rates
- [ ] Set up analytics dashboards by template ID

# DormWay LockedIn Help Center Seed Content



## Getting Started: DormWay LockedIn at a Glance
- LockedIn is the focused, distraction-free experience that sits on top of the DormWay platform.
- Core navigation: Dashboard (overview), Schedule, Documents, Notes (Ace LLM), Preferences, and the Command Palette (`⌘ + K` / `Ctrl + K`).
- Use the Welcome Carousel or the Quick Start checklist to upload your schedule and syllabi immediately after sign-in.
- Real-time toasts and the Processing Progress widget confirm when background jobs begin, finish, or require attention.

## How Do I Upload My Class Schedule?
1. Open `Dashboard → Schedule` (or use the onboarding prompt if you have not added a schedule yet).
2. Click **Import Schedule** to open the upload modal.
3. Choose one of two ingestion modes:
   - **File upload** for `.ics`, `.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, or `.jpeg` exports from your registrar or screenshots of your timetable.
   - **Paste text mode** for copying structured text from portals or email confirmations; DormWay will hand the text to our LLM parser.
4. For file uploads:
   - `.ics` files are parsed client-side and posted to `/api/proxy/mobile/calendar/import-schedule` with the raw calendar text.
   - Images/PDFs are base64-encoded and uploaded to the same endpoint for OCR + parsing.
5. After you submit, a toast confirms “Schedule import started.” The modal closes, and you can continue working while processing runs asynchronously.
6. Check the Processing Progress bubble (bottom-right) or wait for an in-app notification that highlights detected courses, created class blocks, and any conflicts.
7. Once complete, refresh the weekly grid to see events color-coded by course. The jump-to-week shortcut finds the first class if you land mid-term.

### Troubleshooting Schedule Uploads
- If nothing appears within a few minutes, open the Activity log on the dashboard to confirm a `schedule_import_progress` event reached 100%. 
- When the upload fails, the toast will read “Schedule processing failed.” Retry with a higher-resolution image or switch to text mode.

## How Do I Upload a Syllabus?
1. Navigate to `Dashboard → Documents` or open any course inside `Dashboard → Syllabus`.
2. Click **Upload Syllabus** on the course card (the action is also available from the `⋮` menu on each course row).
3. Supported file types include `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`, `.ppt`, `.pptx`, `.txt`, `.md`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.heic`, and `.webp`.
4. When prompted, pick the course context (DormWay pre-selects the active course when launched from the course detail screen).
5. Press **Start Upload**. A toast confirms processing, and the course status changes to “Processing syllabus…” until parsing is complete.
6. Once finished, the syllabus viewer unlocks sections for overview, grading breakdown, weekly cadence, assignments, and instructor details.

### Tips for Successful Syllabus Uploads
- Prefer native PDFs or DOCX exports. Photos work, but expect longer OCR time and potential layout misses.
- If DormWay cannot auto-detect the course code, enter it manually (e.g., `CS-101`). Consistent codes improve matches when classmates upload additional documents.
- You can re-upload updated versions at any time; DormWay keeps version history behind the scenes and shows the newest parsing results.

## What Happens After I Upload a Syllabus?
- Files are sent to the `BrainGains` document service via `/api/proxy/braingains/documents`.
- The ingestion pipeline performs OCR (if needed), detects headers/tables, and runs syllabus-specific classifiers to extract:
  - Course overview, instructor details, office hours
  - Assignment tables with due dates, weight, and grading notes
  - Exams and key milestones (Midterm, Final, Projects)
  - Weekly cadence estimates and workload projections
- Parsed data flows back into the course context so widgets like “Upcoming Deadlines,” workload charts, and the Grade Calculator stay in sync.
- Processing status emits `processing.*` realtime events that feed the on-screen progress badge plus the Activity stream.
- If extraction fails, we log the job ID for support. Users can retry or share the file with the DormWay Success team via Intercom.

## What Happens After I Upload My Schedule?
- DormWay routes `.ics` data through a calendar import workflow that normalizes time zones, merges duplicate series, and stores events as `student_time_blocks`.
- Image/PDF uploads trigger OCR, then the same LLM schedule parser that looks for meeting patterns (course codes, building abbreviations, day/time blocks).
- Events are pushed into the Realtime channel (`schedule_import_progress`) so you receive status updates and we can debug stuck jobs.
- When the workflow finishes, DormWay reconciles imported classes with existing course contexts and prompts you to match any ambiguous codes.
- Schedules are deleted right after parsing, while syllabi are retained to keep refining our AI engine

## How Does DormWay Parse My Information?
- DormWay combines deterministic rules (regex normalization, calendar recurrence logic) with LLM-assisted extraction.
- The LLM components run in managed cloud environments; inputs are scoped to your document/session and never shared outside of DormWay processing chains.
- Parsed outputs are stored as structured JSON, which powers downstream experiences such as dashboards, notifications, and Ace LLM context.
- OCR uses on device computer vision on iOS in combination with Anthropic's computer vision tools

## Is My Information Secure?
- Authentication flows through Auth0; you must sign in with your DormWay or school-provided account before any data is accessible.
- All traffic between the LockedIn web app and DormWay APIs is encrypted over HTTPS.
- Uploaded files are stored in secure cloud storage with access scoped to your account and authorized teammates (support) when escalated.
- Realtime messaging and analytics (Ably, Amplitude, Intercom) use scoped tokens to limit data exposure.
- All personal information is federated and encrypted

## What Is Ace LLM?
- Ace LLM is DormWay’s integrated study assistant. It combines:
  - **Ace Chat** for conversational Q&A grounded in your syllabi, notes, and uploaded docs.
  - **DocVault** to manage documents and track which files are indexed.
  - **PadLock** as a focused note-taking canvas that saves excerpts directly into Ace.
- Chats live under `Dashboard → Notes`; you can pin messages, toggle AI tone in Preferences, and export transcripts.
- When you upload a new document, Ace automatically re-indexes it so follow-up questions reflect the latest material.
- We use a combination of many LLM's (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Amazon and our own) depending on message types

## Focus Mode, Command Palette, and Other Power Features
- **Focus Mode**: Toggle from the View menu in the header to dim navigation, switching LockedIn into a minimal interface ideal for lectures.
- **Command Palette** (`⌘ + K` / `Ctrl + K`): Jump to any page, run quick actions (e.g., “Upload syllabus”), or open settings without touching the mouse.
- **Processing Progress Widget**: Shows up to three active jobs (syllabus parsing, semester planner, schedule imports) with real-time percentages.
- **Realtime Presence**: The connection badge in the header lets you know when DormWay is actively syncing with the backend.

## Features in Development
- DormWay for iOS coming in October!
- Collaborative study rooms that sync Ace LLM conversations across trusted classmates. 
- Automated grade forecasting that blends syllabus weighting with Canvas/Blackboard exports.
- Offline-friendly mode for the desktop app so schedule and notes survive flaky campus Wi-Fi
- A full native MacOS and Windows application

## FAQ Lite
- **Can I delete a syllabus?** Use the course menu → “Remove syllabus.” DormWay retains a rollback snapshot for support but hides it from other students.
- **What if multiple students upload the same syllabus?** DormWay picks the freshest version and keeps older ones as backups.
- **Does LockedIn support tablets or mobile browsers?** The UI is responsive down to ~1024px. Dedicated mobile optimizations are planned.
- **Who can see my uploads?** Only you and invited DormWay teammates for your institution. Shared documents (like community syllabi) require explicit opt-in.

## Support & Escalation
- Use the Intercom messenger in the bottom-right corner for quick questions and to report bugs.
- Collect screenshots, the timestamp of your upload, and (if possible) the file you attempted to import. This helps the support engineer replay the workflow.
- Production incidents (stuck imports, missing classes) are routed to the DormWay Engine team’s on-call channel for immediate triage.
- DormWay is currently two people (hi!) so bear with us as we scale!

# AI Documentation Guide

Guidelines for AI-assisted documentation across DormWay.

## Scope
- When to use AI updates vs manual edits
- What counts as canonical vs exploratory documentation
- Tagging and naming conventions for generated content

## Notes
- Keep generated content in the `Generated/` bucket.
- Prefer short, high-signal summaries over long narrative dumps.

# Schedule Import via Screenshot - Implementation Status
*Created: 2025-07-13*

## Overview
This document maps our completed schedule import implementation against Journey 2 (Syllabus Upload) requirements and identifies gaps for the 5 core user journeys.

## ✅ What We've Completed

### 🎯 **Core Schedule Import Flow**
- **Screenshot-based schedule import** fully implemented
- **LLM-based OCR processing** via Temporal workflows
- **Real-time progress updates** via Ably
- **Course context creation** with proper relationships
- **Dual storage architecture** (time_blocks + student_time_blocks)
- **Beautiful success screen** with import summary

### 🔧 **Technical Infrastructure**
- **Temporal workflows** for async processing
- **Ably real-time messaging** for progress updates  
- **Course context system** with human-readable IDs
- **Enrollment relationships** with proper dependency types
- **Campus-wide data collection** for activity patterns
- **Individual calendar reconciliation** support

### 📱 **iOS Implementation**
- **Share Extension** capability (ready for Xcode config)
- **Camera and photo library** import options
- **Progress tracking** with animated UI
- **Success celebration** with detailed results
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages

## ❌ Missing for Journey 2 Compliance

### 1. **File Upload Support**
**Gap**: Currently only supports screenshots
**Need**: PDF and Word document upload for syllabi
- Add file picker to import options
- Implement document text extraction
- Route through existing BrainGains pipeline

### 2. **Editable Review Step**
**Gap**: Success screen is read-only
**Need**: Allow users to edit extracted courses
- Course editing interface
- Add/remove course capability
- Re-save functionality

### 3. **AI Insights Generation**
**Gap**: No study plan or insights shown
**Need**: Generate course-specific insights
- Workload assessment
- Study recommendations
- Milestone warnings

### 4. **Calendar Integration Options**
**Gap**: Events auto-added without choice
**Need**: User control over calendar integration
- Preview events in calendar view
- Select which events to add
- Reminder preferences

## 🎯 **Alignment with Core Journeys**

### **Journey 1: First-Time Onboarding** 
✅ **Ready**: Schedule import can be part of onboarding flow

### **Journey 2: Syllabus Upload** 
🟡 **Partial**: Screenshot import works, need syllabus document support

### **Journey 3: Calendar Connection**
✅ **Ready**: Events are created and stored properly

### **Journey 4: First BrainGains Use**
🟡 **Partial**: Course contexts created but no insights generated yet

### **Journey 5: Daily Return User**
✅ **Ready**: Course data available for context-aware displays

## 📋 **Next Steps for Journey 2 Completion**

### **Priority 1: Document Upload**
- Add file picker to ScheduleImportView
- Route PDF/Word files to BrainGains processor
- Unify upload flow with screenshot flow

### **Priority 2: Review & Edit**
- Add edit mode to success screen
- Implement course modification UI
- Allow re-processing after edits

### **Priority 3: AI Insights**
- Generate study plans from course data
- Show workload assessment
- Provide course-specific recommendations

### **Priority 4: Calendar Control**
- Add event preview screen
- Implement selective event adding
- Add reminder configuration

## 🚀 **Impact Assessment**

### **What We Can Ship Now**:
- Screenshot-based schedule import
- Course discovery and context creation
- Real-time import progress
- Success confirmation with stats

### **What Needs Work for Full Journey 2**:
- Document upload pipeline integration
- User editing capabilities
- AI insights generation
- Calendar integration choices

## 📊 **Implementation Effort**

**High Priority (1-2 days)**:
- File picker integration
- Route to BrainGains processor

**Medium Priority (3-5 days)**:
- Course editing interface
- AI insights generation

**Lower Priority (1-2 days)**:
- Calendar preview/selection
- Reminder preferences

## 💡 **Recommendation**

Our schedule import implementation provides excellent foundation for Journey 2 but needs document upload support to be complete. The screenshot flow demonstrates the technical architecture works perfectly - we just need to extend it to handle PDF/Word syllabi through the existing BrainGains pipeline.

**Suggested Launch Strategy**: 
1. Ship screenshot import as "Quick Schedule Setup"
2. Add document upload as "Full Syllabus Analysis" 
3. Both flows converge on same success/calendar integration

This leverages our completed work while addressing Journey 2 requirements.

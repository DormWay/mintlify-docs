# **Campus Connect x Live Nation Partnership Proposal**

  

## **Executive Presentation Deck**

  

### **Slide 1: Campus Connect x Live Nation (Title)**

  

**Direct access to 19.3 million college students nationwide**

_With a strategy to dominate your 50 hardest-to-reach college markets_

---

### **Slide 2: DormWay’s Nationwide Platform**

  

**Available to Every College Student, Day One (Launching Fall 2025)**

- **19.3 M students** across 4,000+ campuses nationwide – accessible from day one of launch
    
- **Universal availability:** Urban, suburban, _and_ rural campuses – every market covered
    
- **Daily engagement:** Academic integration means students check the app 5–10× daily (for schedules, assignments, etc.)
    
- **Network effects:** The platform gets smarter and more essential as more students join
    

  

**Your Opportunity:** Be the **exclusive entertainment partner** across the entire platform _from launch_

---

### **Slide 3: Why Every Student Will Use DormWay**

  

**Universal Daily Utility (Not Just Another Social App):**

- Auto-syncs class schedules from any LMS (Canvas, Blackboard, etc.)
    
- AI syllabus parsing via email (send to **syllabus@dormway.app**)
    
- Campus maps & navigation that work at **every** university
    
- Assignment tracking with smart study reminders
    
- Campus event discovery and group coordination tools
    

  

**No “Cold Start” Problem – Value on Day One:** Every student gets utility immediately (even with zero friends on the app). This is already proven: **47K+ students at University of Michigan** adopted DormWay in a pilot, validating that academic utility drives daily use.

---

### **Slide 4: Your Strategic Problem**

  

**Within Our 19.3 M Student Universe:** There are **50 isolated college towns – 3.75 M students – effectively in media dead zones.**

- Average **85+ miles from major metros** (far outside big-city media reach)
    
- Local media doesn’t effectively reach or influence them
    
- Traditional marketing in these areas is completely ineffective
    
- **These students are some of your highest-value potential fans, but they’re in your lowest-reach markets**
    

  

**Bottom Line:** These are the markets where **you need us most** – and where we provide direct access.

---

### **Slide 5: The College Town Reality (Data Examples)**

  

**Oxford, MS – University of Mississippi (19K students)**

- ~75 miles from Memphis (≈1.5 hour drive)
    
- 160+ miles from Jackson (state capital)
    
- **95% of students have cars** (a necessity, not a luxury, in this rural area)
    
- Local newspaper circulation: ~5,100
    
- Memphis radio/TV signals don’t reach Oxford
    
- Students exist in an “Ole Miss bubble” – your usual marketing never penetrates
    

  

**State College, PA – Penn State (42K students)**

- 136 miles from Pittsburgh; 190 miles from Philadelphia (3+ hours away)
    
- Town population: 42K residents **+ 45K students** (students _are_ the town)
    
- Local newspaper circulation: ~9,000
    
- No major-city media penetration (too far from Philly/Pittsburgh media markets)
    
- Students describe living in the “Happy Valley bubble” – isolated from outside advertising
    

---

### **Slide 6: Geographic Isolation = Marketing Blackout**

  

**Pullman, WA – Washington State University (22K students)**

- 280 miles from Seattle (5–6 hour drive); 75 miles from Spokane
    
- Greyhound bus to Seattle takes ~8 hours
    
- Only ~32% of students have parking permits (most **can’t easily escape** town)
    
- **Zero local TV stations** (Pullman relies on distant Spokane media)
    
- Students report “culture shock” due to extreme isolation – they’re cut off from typical media
    

  

**Clemson, SC – Clemson University (23K students)**

- ~2.5 hours from both Atlanta and Charlotte
    
- Nearest small city: Greenville, SC (45 min away) – limited regional media
    
- **No local TV station** dedicated to Clemson
    
- ~47% of freshmen bring cars (rural necessity)
    
- A strong “Clemson bubble” – campus culture dominates, outside marketing rarely seen
    

---

### **Slide 7: The Media Desert Pattern**

  

**Santa Barbara, CA – UCSB (23K students)**

- 90–100 miles from Los Angeles (2.5–3 hours with traffic, separate media market)
    
- **Billboard advertising is banned** countywide (no outdoor ads to reach students)
    
- LA radio signals don’t reach Santa Barbara; local radio is minimal
    
- Limited train service to LA (2.5–3 hours) – many students without cars feel _trapped_
    

  

**The Pattern Across All 50 Isolated Markets:**

- Local media exists but is **campus-focused** (reaches only those on campus already)
    
- Big-city media doesn’t reach these towns at all
    
- Students get news and event info mainly from **social media** (not TV/radio/newspapers)
    
- Terrestrial **radio is considered a “last resort”** by today’s college students
    

---

### **Slide 8: Why Traditional Marketing Fails in College Towns**

  

**What Doesn’t Work (and Why):**

- ❌ **Local Radio:** Students stream Spotify/Apple Music; almost none tune into AM/FM radio
    
- ❌ **Local Newspapers:** Tiny circulation (5K–9K); students don’t read print news in town
    
- ❌ **Metro Media:** Big-city TV/radio signals don’t reach these areas, and students aren’t consuming them
    
- ❌ **Billboards:** Often nonexistent (e.g. Santa Barbara’s ban) or simply ignored by students
    
- ❌ **Campus Flyers/Posters:** Removed within 24 hours; students suffer “flyer fatigue” and tune them out
    
- ❌ **Email Blasts:** below 0.5% open rates from generic campus emails – effectively spam to Gen Z
    

  

**Your Current Reality:** Spending $25–$40+ **CPA** on these markets _with zero attribution_ – and still not moving the needle. You’re essentially flying blind and wasting budget on channels you can’t even measure.

---

### **Slide 9: DormWay Solves the “Impossible” Problem**

  

**Nationwide Platform + Hyper-Local Intelligence** gives us a unique ability to reach and engage these students:

  

**We Reach Every Student:**

- **Nationwide scale:** 19.3 M students across all campuses on one platform
    
- **Not optional – essential:** Daily academic utility ensures students open DormWay; it’s not a mere social app they can ignore
    
- **No friends needed:** Students use it for classes and schedule management, regardless of network effects
    
- **High trust & engagement:** It’s a trusted tool for academic life, which makes our engagement (e.g. event suggestions) more credible
    

  

**We Understand Local Context:** DormWay isn’t just broad, it’s hyper-local by design. We know…

- When **Ole Miss** students finish finals (and that 95% have cars – meaning they’ll drive somewhere to celebrate)
    
- When **Penn State** has a 45K-student long weekend (and everyone’s looking for something to do)
    
- When **Pullman** students are stuck in town without cars (making local on-campus events crucial)
    
- When **Clemson’s** entire campus is celebrating a big win (ideal time to promote a show or festival nearby)
    

  

In short, we combine **nationwide reach** with **market-by-market context** – something no traditional channel or generic app can do.

---

### **Slide 10: Contextual Intelligence – Examples**

  

DormWay’s platform tailors messages to each campus **at just the right moment**. For example:

- **Post-Exam Relief (universal):** Finals are over – that’s when we push: _“Penn State finals ended today. How about [Artist] live on Friday at Bryce Jordan Center?”_
    
- **Geographic Captivity (isolated campuses):** _“Stuck in Pullman this weekend? [Artist] is playing Saturday at Beasley Coliseum – don’t miss out!”_
    
- **Group Dynamics (car-heavy campuses):** _“95% of Ole Miss students have cars…so fill yours up and road-trip to FedExForum tonight for [Artist]’s show!”_
    
- **Break Travel Targeting (regional draws):** _“Clemson fall break starts tomorrow – perfect time to catch [Artist] in Atlanta (2.5 hours away). Split gas with friends and go!”_
    

  

These context-driven prompts feel organic (because they tie into each campus’s real situation) – and they convert far better than generic “Buy tickets!” ads. We deliver _the right message at the perfect time_ for each market.

---

### **Slide 11: The 50 Strategic College Markets**

  

We’ve identified 50 high-priority college markets for Live Nation, categorized by severity of media isolation and opportunity:

- **Tier 1: Complete Media Blackout** (15 campuses, ~600K students)
    
    _Characteristics:_ 40–68% of the town population are students, 85–280 miles from nearest major metro, **zero** effective traditional media reach.
    
    _Examples:_ Ole Miss, Penn State, Clemson, Pullman (WSU), UCSB, Virginia Tech, etc.
    
- **Tier 2: Strong College Towns** (25 campuses, ~800K students)
    
    _Characteristics:_ 25–40% of local population are students, regional isolation with limited media reach (not as extreme as Tier 1).
    
    _Examples:_ Texas A&M, Auburn, Indiana University, UC Davis, Iowa State, etc.
    
- **Tier 3 (and 4): Large Markets** (10 campuses, ~2.4 M students)
    
    _Characteristics:_ Big universities in or near major metros – important for broader coverage and cross-market influence.
    
    _Examples:_ Ohio State, University of Arizona, UCLA, University of Florida, etc. (These are not isolated, but reaching their students adds significant volume and value.)
    

  

_Our initial focus is Tiers 1 & 2_ – the truly hard-to-reach college towns – where the impact and need are greatest. Tier 3/4 campuses will be icing on the cake as we scale.

---

### **Slide 12: Traditional vs. DormWay – Performance Metrics**

  

**Traditional Campus Marketing (Today):**

- **$25–$40+** customer acquisition cost (CPA) per ticket buyer in college demos
    
- **0.5–1.5%** typical CTR on social media ads targeting students
    
- **Radio**: Gen Z uses it _“only as a last resort,”_ per surveys – negligible influence
    
- **Attribution:** Essentially none. Hard to know what actually drove a student to buy a ticket (if anything).
    
- **One-size-fits-all:** Same playbook used for Pullman, WA as for UCLA – despite drastically different contexts (inefficient and ineffective).
    

  

**DormWay Campus Connect (Projected Performance):**

- **<$15 CPA** per ticket buyer – _a 60%+ reduction_ in cost through our efficient, targeted channel
    
- **8–15% contextual CTR** on in-app promotions – _10× higher_ engagement by delivering content students care about in the moment
    
- **Built-in daily channel:** No extra effort to get eyeballs – students are already on DormWay daily for school, so promotion slots are native
    
- **Full-funnel tracking:** See every step from initial event suggestion → click → ticket purchase, finally giving you clear ROI data
    
- **Market-specific optimization:** Campaigns tuned per campus (because Pullman ≠ UCLA). No more wasted spend on irrelevant impressions.
    

  

_In short: DormWay drastically lowers your cost, boosts engagement, and_ **_proves_** _what works with real data._ Imagine knowing exactly which promo filled a venue – we can do that.

---

### **Slide 13: Why Tackle College Towns First?**

  

These isolated college markets are the **perfect proving ground** for our partnership:

- **Highest Need:** These students can’t be effectively reached through any other channel today. They’re **hungry for entertainment** and have pent-up demand. If something works here, they respond enthusiastically – because no one else is catering to them.
    
- **Clearest Attribution:** In these markets, there’s little “marketing noise.” If we drive ticket sales, it will be clearly attributable to DormWay (no other channels to muddy the waters). It’s like a controlled lab environment to prove ROI beyond doubt.
    
- **Highest Impact:** Right now, these venues are often half-empty or these students just don’t go to shows. By succeeding here, we fill venues you’re currently ignoring. It creates success stories (and revenue) where none existed, which then build the case to roll the model out to bigger urban campuses next.
    

  

**Think of it this way:** If we can crack the code in the _most difficult_ markets, scaling to easier ones (cities) will be a slam dunk.

---

### **Slide 14: Market Intelligence You’ll Gain**

  

Partnering with DormWay doesn’t just sell tickets – it gives Live Nation unprecedented insights:

  

**College Town Insights (real examples):**

- _“Penn State finals week ends 12/15 – expect ~45K students suddenly free for events.”_
    
- _“Oxford, MS: 95% student car ownership = huge opportunity to promote Memphis shows (students will drive).”_
    
- _“Pullman, WA: 68% of students have no car = focus on on-campus events or shuttle buses for big shows.”_
    
- _“Santa Barbara: Billboard ban = DormWay is literally the only viable visual ad channel here.”_
    

  

**Cross-Market Patterns:**

- Genre preferences by campus isolation level (e.g., do isolated college towns favor country music more? EDM less? We’ll find out.)
    
- Impact of car ownership on willingness to travel to a show (data-driven radius calculations per campus)
    
- Academic calendar alignment opportunities – e.g., coordinating tour dates with multiple schools’ spring breaks or rivalry game weekends
    
- Regional routing optimizations – linking nearby college towns into a cohesive tour circuit (efficient clustering of dates)
    

  

**Predictive Intelligence:**

- Which markets need local campus venues versus which can fill a metro arena (based on real-time student interest data)
    
- Optimal pricing models by student transportation options (price sensitivity if travel is involved, etc.)
    
- Group ticketing potential by campus – e.g., if 95% have cars at Ole Miss, promote carpool group deals; if 30% have cars at Pullman, promote on-campus group experiences
    

  

_All of this intelligence flows to Live Nation,_ informing decisions from booking to marketing. Over time, these insights compound into a significant strategic advantage in touring.

---

### **Slide 15: Partnership Options – Three Tiers**

  

We offer flexible partnership tiers to align with Live Nation’s priorities:

- **Tier 1: “College Town Domination”** – Focus on the 50 hardest-to-reach campuses (Tier 1 markets first, then Tier 2).
    
    – **Cost:** ~$2K–$5K/month per campus (depending on scope of promotions)
    
    – **Includes:** Contextual show promotions, hyper-local triggers, dedicated focus on filling venues in media blackout markets
    
    – **Goal:** Prove we can do the “impossible” – turn these dead zones into thriving concert markets.
    
- **Tier 2: “Regional Networks”** – Expand to key urban & suburban campuses, building regional synergies.
    
    – **Cost:** ~$5K–$15K/month per campus
    
    – **Includes:** Cross-market touring intelligence, coordination of transportation (buses, carpools) for students to reach regional shows, integration with 150+ campuses.
    
    – **Goal:** Leverage college clusters around metro areas for larger tours, optimize multi-campus draws.
    
- **Tier 3: “National Platform”** – Full 500-campus coverage as an enterprise partnership (exclusive entertainment partner status).
    
    – **Cost:** Custom enterprise pricing (to be negotiated based on scale/features)
    
    – **Includes:** Exclusive access to the entire 19.3 M student user base, predictive demand forecasting tools, and nationwide campaigns across all campus types.
    
    – **Goal:** Make Live Nation the **exclusive entertainment brand** across college life nationwide, with a data advantage no competitor can touch.
    

  

_All tiers_ include our analytics dashboard, targeting tools, and ongoing strategy support. It’s just a matter of how wide and fast we scale together.

---

### **Slide 16: Pilot Program – Strategic Venue Validation**

  

As a **free pilot**, we propose testing in 5 markets that cover every challenging scenario. This pilot will validate strategies for different venue types and distances:

- **Ole Miss (Univ. of Mississippi)** → _Metro Arena Test (Memphis)_
    
    – **Students:** 19K (in Oxford, MS) – **95% have cars**
    
    – **Target Venue:** FedExForum, Memphis (18K capacity arena, ~75 miles away)
    
    – **Strategy:** Can we extend a major venue’s draw 75 miles by activating a college town? _Test:_ How many Ole Miss students will road-trip to Memphis for a big show when they actually know about it?
    
- **Penn State (State College, PA)** → _On-Campus Arena + Regional City_
    
    – **Students:** 42K undergrad (huge single-campus market)
    
    – **Target Venues:** Bryce Jordan Center on campus (11K cap), _and_ PPG Paints Arena in Pittsburgh (136 miles away)
    
    – **Strategy:** Can we **guarantee a sellout** at a campus venue by marketing directly to students? And simultaneously, will a portion travel 136 miles to a city show? _Test:_ Make Penn State a must-stop on tours (with full attendance), and gauge willingness to trek to Pittsburgh for major artists.
    
- **Clemson (Clemson, SC)** → _Regional Hub vs. Metro Comparison_
    
    – **Students:** 23K (with 47% of freshmen bringing cars; high car ownership overall)
    
    – **Target Venues:** Bon Secours Wellness Arena in Greenville, SC (45-minute drive), and State Farm Arena in Atlanta, GA (130 miles, ~2.5 hours)
    
    – **Strategy:** What’s the **tipping point** for travel? Compare turnout for a regional mid-size venue nearby vs. a major arena much farther. _Test:_ If we promote the same artist, do Clemson students prefer a closer 45-min show or will they caravan 2.5 hours for a bigger concert? Where’s the drop-off, and how can we optimize messaging for each distance?
    
- **Pullman (Washington State University)** → _Captive On-Campus Audience_
    
    – **Students:** 22K (Pullman, WA) – only ~32% have cars (very low mobility)
    
    – **Target Venue:** Beasley Coliseum on campus (11.6K capacity)
    
    – **Strategy:** With an isolated campus where students _can’t easily leave_, can we routinely fill the on-campus arena? _Test:_ Prove that a “captive” college market can produce sold-out shows when marketed through DormWay. (And explore options like chartering buses for the 75-mile trip to Spokane for select events, to see if even low-mobility students will go if transport is provided.)
    
- **UCSB (UC Santa Barbara)** → _Hybrid Local + Metro Strategy_
    
    – **Students:** 23K (Isla Vista/Santa Barbara, CA) – moderate car access, entirely separate media market from LA
    
    – **Target Venues:** Santa Barbara Bowl (4,500 cap outdoor amphitheater in town) and Los Angeles venues (~90 miles away, e.g. The Forum, Hollywood Bowl)
    
    – **Strategy:** Can we **dominate a local venue** with student attendance _and_ also funnel students to big L.A. shows? _Test:_ Drive 2,000+ students into SB Bowl for each show (making students the majority of the crowd), and assess interest in organizing group transport for LA concerts. Also measure impact of the total lack of billboards/traditional ads – DormWay will likely be the primary awareness channel here.
    

  

_(See the supplemental whitepaper for detailed analysis behind each market and metrics we’ll measure.)_ These pilots cost Live Nation **$0** – we’re investing in proving the model. By covering a range of scenarios, we’ll gather proof-of-concept data to de-risk a full rollout.

---

### **Slide 17: Year 1 Roadmap (2026) – Launch and Scale**

  

**Q1 2026:** **Platform launches nationwide** (all 4,000+ campuses open on DormWay)

- Initiate the 5-market pilot program (Live Nation partnered venues in each test) – free validation phase
    
- Establish baseline engagement and conversion metrics across various campus types
    
- Collect feedback and optimize the app’s event features with real user data
    

  

**Q2 2026:** Scale what’s proven in college towns

- Roll out to all 15 Tier-1 “blackout” markets (~600K students) with full promotions
    
- Begin expansion into Tier-2 strong college towns (adding ~25 markets, 800K students)
    
- Start pilot campaigns at a few large urban campuses (e.g. test strategies at Ohio State, UCLA for broader insights)
    

  

**Q3–Q4 2026:** Achieve full coverage of the 50 priority college towns

- That’s ~3.75 M students now actively reached in the previously “impossible” markets
    
- Use learnings to refine approach for big city campuses (where competition for attention is higher, but we now have momentum)
    
- Launch **cross-market touring intelligence** features – leveraging data from multiple campuses to inform tour routing and promotions in real time (e.g. linking clusters of schools on fall break for a regional festival)
    

  

**Year 1 (2026) Target Outcome:** If focusing on ~50 college town campuses, projected partnership value is **$1.3M–$5.3M ARR** to DormWay (depending on tier level of service) – translating to tens of thousands of tickets sold and valuable proof-of-concept revenue for Live Nation. _(In other words, a modest investment for LN that turns previously untapped markets into new revenue streams.)_

---

### **Slide 18: The Long Game – Years 2 & 3 Scaling**

  

Once we nail the model in Year 1, we expand to full national coverage and deeper integration:

  

**Year 2 (2027):** Approximately 150 campuses optimized

- All Tier 1 and 2 college towns fully active, plus major urban universities onboarded and learning optimized
    
- We project ~8 M student active reach by end of Year 2 as word-of-mouth and academic utility drive adoption
    
- Revenue scale: **$9M–$22.5M ARR** (if Live Nation opts for broad Tier-2 deployment across these 150 schools)
    
- Focus: cement DormWay as _the_ channel for college promotions, and integrate insights into Live Nation’s regional planning (e.g. know which city tours should market to nearby colleges)
    

  

**Year 3 (2028):** ~500 campuses = true nationwide dominance

- Virtually every major campus covered – from small colleges to the biggest state schools
    
- Active reach of up to 19.3 M students (the full college population) as those first classes of users carry over and new freshmen onboard
    
- DormWay evolves into a **full touring intelligence platform** – at this scale, we can predict demand for any artist in any region by looking at student engagement data
    
- Revenue scale: **$30M–$75M ARR** (reflecting Live Nation’s deeper integration as an enterprise partner across all campuses)
    
- Live Nation’s **position at this stage:** You have an exclusive lock on the college demographic from the day they step on campus to graduation. Competitors are effectively shut out of the student market because DormWay + Live Nation have become synonymous with live entertainment for the college crowd.
    

  

_(These figures are projections, but they illustrate the trajectory and enormous upside of capturing the college demographic early.)_

---

### **Slide 19: Beyond Ticket Sales – Strategic Benefits**

  

The DormWay partnership isn’t just about immediate ticket sales. It builds long-term advantages for Live Nation:

  

**Platform Intelligence (At Scale):** By Year 2–3, the data collected can transform how you plan and execute live events.

- **Artist Development:** Use college towns as a **testing ground for emerging artists**. Students are enthusiastic, forgiving audiences – a perfect place to build a fan base before a major tour. We can identify which campuses respond best to new genres or up-and-coming acts. 10K-cap campus arenas are ideal for artists’ first big shows (and those artists will remember who helped fill them).
    
- **Tour Routing & Optimization:** Incorporate college-driven demand into tour planning. Suddenly, adding a “college town” leg can be profitable because we ensure those venues fill up. We’ll know exactly how far students will travel (using car ownership and interest data), so you can extend the radius of major city shows. Align tours with **academic calendars** – avoid midterm week, target big rivalry weekends or welcome weeks for max turnout. DormWay data will highlight the optimal routing through, say, the Southeast by linking events when multiple schools have break at the same time, etc.
    
- **Student Lifetime Value:** Today’s students are **tomorrow’s high-value concert customers**. By capturing them in college, Live Nation can keep them in your ecosystem post-graduation. DormWay helps build loyalty during these formative college years – which translates to brand preference later. A student who found their favorite concert experience via DormWay+Live Nation at 20 could become a season ticket holder or festival VIP at 25. With 19.3 M students cycling through, this is a continuous pipeline of new lifetime customers for Live Nation.
    

  

In essence, we’re not just selling tickets – we’re **seeding the next generation** of live music fans with habits and data that benefit Live Nation’s business for years to come.

---

### **Slide 20: Why This Works – Our Structural Advantage**

  

There’s a reason this partnership will succeed where others haven’t: **DormWay’s model creates a structural advantage** that neither Live Nation nor competitors have had before.

  

**College Towns Need You:**

- Students in places like Pullman, Oxford, and Clemson are _starved_ for entertainment options. They _want_ live music and events – they just have no effective way to discover them.
    
- There are no competing marketing channels cluttering their attention. When we present a concert opportunity, it’s likely the _only_ real invitation they’ve seen. Engagement is high because we’re fulfilling a genuine unmet need.
    

  

**And **You Need College Towns:**

- These 3.75 M students represent passionate fans you’re currently not reaching at all. That’s a huge untapped market of young consumers with disposable income for experiences.
    
- Campus venues (10–12K cap) that you operate or could partner with are sitting underutilized. With guaranteed crowds, those become viable tour stops (new revenue).
    
- Major metro venues are missing out on attendees who live 75–100 miles away in college towns. DormWay extends your effective market radius, pulling those fans in and boosting sell-through in large venues.
    
- These college towns are perfect “test markets” – if a strategy or artist resonates here, it’s a strong signal for broader demand.
    

  

**DormWay Connects Both Sides:**

- We’re the **only platform** that every student in these markets uses daily. Our content isn’t seen as intrusive ads, but as helpful, timely information – because we’ve woven it into their academic life flow.
    
- Our academic and location intelligence lets us time promotions _perfectly_ (we know when midterms end, when homecoming is, when a campus is in celebration mode, etc.). This timing precision is something no radio or generic social media ad can match.
    
- We combine **geo-data and behavioral data** to target the right venue for each campus. (For example, we might push the on-campus show for Pullman where travel is hard, but push the big city show for Ole Miss where students can drive.)
    
- We **prove results** with actual data attribution. Live Nation will finally see direct evidence of marketing spend converting to ticket sales in these markets – solving the age-old “half my marketing works, but which half?” dilemma.
    

  

_DormWay’s Moat:_ This strategy is defensible – our deep integration into students’ daily lives (class schedules, campus services) makes our platform a **must-have utility** rather than an optional app. That creates a moat no traditional media or late-arriving competitor can easily cross. As our exclusive launch partner, Live Nation taps into this closed loop from the beginning, before anyone else can.

---

### **Slide 21: The Data Backs It Up**

  

Everything in our approach is built on observed student behavior and market data:

  

✅ **Students don’t consume local traditional media** – on isolated campuses, local papers and radio might as well not exist for Gen Z.

✅ **Metro media doesn’t reach college towns** – if it’s 100 miles away, it might as well be on the moon in terms of student awareness.

✅ **Geographic isolation = captive audience** – when students are far from cities and can’t easily leave, they focus on campus life (and crave anything new that comes to them).

✅ **High car ownership = willingness to travel** – when students _do_ have cars (SEC schools, etc.), they are willing to drive 1–2 hours for entertainment… _if they actually hear about it in time_.

✅ **“Campus bubble” effect is real** – in college towns, students live in a self-contained world; mainstream marketing (TV, big websites, etc.) rarely penetrates their bubble.

✅ **Social media needs targeting to work** – students get info from Instagram/TikTok, yes, but unless content is hyper-targeted (by location, timing, and relevance) it’s just noise. Random ads for shows 3 hours away don’t register – context is everything.

  

**DormWay’s Position:** We are the _only_ platform that students across these 50 markets actively use daily and that can deliver **hyper-local, contextually timed** entertainment promotions. We bridge the gap between eager student audiences and your events, in a way that’s finally effective and measurable. The data and early trials validate that this approach works when nothing else does.

### **Slide 22: Next Steps – Partnering from Launch**

  

**Become the Launch Partner** and let’s bring live entertainment to every campus together:

- **Week 1:** Formalize the partnership and align on pilot markets/venues (choose the initial 5 test campuses and target shows). Kickoff meeting with DormWay and Live Nation teams.
    
- **Weeks 2–4:** Integration and dashboard setup – connect DormWay’s system with Live Nation’s event feed, set up tracking links, and train your team on our live analytics dashboard. (This ensures by launch, everything runs smoothly.)
    
- **Months 1–2:** **Free Pilot Execution** – DormWay rolls out the tailored promotions in the 5 pilot markets (as outlined). We monitor and optimize in real-time. Weekly check-ins to share early results and adjust messaging or timing as needed.
    
- **Month 3:** Pilot wraps up – we conduct a full **ROI evaluation** and performance review with your team. We’ll see exactly how many tickets we drove, CPA achieved, etc., in each test market. At this point, the value should be clear.
    
- **Q2 2026:** Expansion decision – with pilot success, we immediately scale to all 50 college town markets (Tier 1 and 2) as agreed. Integration deepens, and DormWay becomes an official part of your marketing mix in those areas.
    
- **Late 2026 into 2027:** Begin rolling out to additional campuses (Tier 3 urban campuses, etc.) per the roadmap and according to the tier package you choose.
    

  

**Investment Outline:**

- **Pilot Phase:** $0 cost – we are investing in proving our solution’s value to Live Nation.
    
- **Year 1 (2026) – 50 college towns:** ~$1.3M–$5.3M total (depending on the tier level and number of campuses covered). This can be structured monthly or quarterly. _(For perspective, that’s roughly the cost of marketing one or two major tours – now applied to lock down 50 markets.)_
    
- **Year 2 (2027) – ~150 campuses:** ~$9M–$22.5M (scaling up coverage and features; exact figure depends on chosen campuses and depth of integration, and will be offset by increased ticket revenue from those markets).
    
- **Year 3 (2028) – ~500 campuses:** ~$30M–$75M (for full national dominance; this would be a comprehensive enterprise partnership across all student markets).
    

  

_These investments are adjustable based on scope – and remember, they come with directly measurable returns._ After the free pilot, you will see clear data to justify any spend.

---

### **Executive Summary**

  

Campus Connect’s pilot program with Live Nation will test five distinct strategies across a variety of college markets, representing roughly 3.75 M students in historically unreachable “media desert” college towns. By examining different venue types and travel distances, this pilot will generate data to guide a national rollout across all 19.3 M students.

  

**Key Insight:** College towns aren’t just underserved markets for live entertainment – they represent three major _missed opportunities_ for venues and tours today:

1. **Campus venue sellouts:** Dozens of 10K+ arenas on college campuses that could be filled with the right marketing (currently underutilized because students don’t hear about shows).
    
2. **Local town venue dominance:** Prime 3–5K capacity venues in college towns that struggle to draw students due to marketing gaps – despite often sitting in a sea of thousands of potential fans.
    
3. **Metro area catchment extension:** Major city venues could draw from an extra 75–100 miles out (tapping nearby college populations) if those students were engaged – increasing ticket sales for big tours.
    

  

The pilot targets one example of each scenario (and a couple that combine elements) to validate how DormWay + Live Nation can unlock these opportunities. Success will demonstrate that what was once “impossible” – reliably reaching and filling shows in isolated college markets – is now achievable, and it will provide a template to replicate nationwide.

---

### **I. The College Town Venue Problem**

  

#### **Current State: Missed Opportunities in College Markets**

  

There are three venue-related challenges in college towns that Live Nation currently faces:

- **Campus Venues (10K–12K capacity):** More than 50 major universities have large on-campus arenas or stadiums that can host concerts. However, outside of sports and the rare superstar performer, these venues see only ~30–40% utilization for concerts. The common refrain is “college stops don’t pay” – tours skip them due to historically poor sales. The reality is students didn’t show up because they often **didn’t know** about the shows. These venues could be _guaranteed sellouts_ with proper student-focused marketing, transforming them from afterthoughts into must-have tour stops.
    
- **Local College Town Venues (3K–5K capacity):** Many college towns feature mid-sized venues (theaters, amphitheaters) perfect for mid-tier or emerging artists. These venues compete to book shows but struggle to fill them because traditional marketing doesn’t reach the student population. Often, the **student body outnumbers the local resident population** (e.g., in Isla Vista 80%+ are students). Without campus-centric channels, a show can be booked in a college town and yet 70% of students never hear about it. The opportunity: dominate these venues by making students aware; the audience is right there waiting.
    
- **Metro Venue Catchment Areas:** Large metro arenas typically consider their “market” as roughly a 30–50 mile radius. But many colleges lie just outside that radius (60–100 miles away) – currently ignored in marketing plans. Meanwhile, at schools like Ole Miss or Auburn, a huge majority have cars and _would_ drive 1–2 hours for the right show. The gap is that those students are never targeted by the metro’s advertising. With a direct channel, every major Live Nation arena could effectively extend its reach to include one or more college campuses just beyond the usual range – boosting attendance for shows that might otherwise have empty seats.
    

  

#### **The Marketing Gap**

  

Concrete data from these markets illustrate why the gap exists:

- **State College, PA (Penn State):** Local newspaper circulation is ~9,000 (for a town with 45,000 students!) – traditional print media covers maybe 20% of the student body at best. No local TV station, and Pittsburgh/Philly media doesn’t reach here.
    
- **Oxford, MS (Ole Miss):** The town paper circulates ~5,100 copies vs. 19,000 students. Memphis media doesn’t cover Oxford, so students live largely unexposed to big-city ads.
    
- **Pullman, WA (WSU):** There are _zero_ Pullman TV stations. The area gets only faint signals from Spokane. The radio landscape is sparse – effectively no reliable radio reach. Pullman is an island of students with minimal external media influence.
    
- **Santa Barbara, CA (UCSB):** Santa Barbara County has essentially **eliminated billboards**. It’s a beautiful place – but that means no outdoor advertising reaching students on highways or in town. The city has its own media market separate from LA, and students without cars don’t see LA ads.
    

  

**Result:** Even when Live Nation books great artists at venues near these colleges, students often **never hear a word** about it through their usual channels. Traditional marketing simply doesn’t infiltrate the “campus bubble.”

  

_In short, it’s not lack of student interest – it’s lack of awareness._ The Pent-up demand is there, but the message isn’t getting through.

---

### **II. Pilot Market Selection: Strategic Rationale**

  

Each pilot market has been chosen to answer a specific strategic question and to be a prototype for many similar markets among the 50 target campuses. The table below summarizes the logic:

|**Market (Campus)**|**Student Pop.**|**Car Ownership**|**Distance to Major Metro**|**Venue Focus**|**Strategic Question to Answer**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Ole Miss (Oxford)**|19K|~95% (very high)|75 miles to Memphis|Metro arena|Will students drive ~75 miles if we solve awareness?|
|**Penn State**|42K|~50% (moderate)|136 miles to Pittsburgh|Campus + regional|Can we consistently fill an on-campus arena? (And get some to travel farther)|
|**Clemson**|23K|~47% (above avg.)|130 miles to Atlanta (also 45 min to Greenville)|Regional hub|What’s the drop-off between a 45-min drive vs 2.5-hour drive?|
|**Pullman (WSU)**|22K|~32% (low)|280 miles to Seattle (75 to Spokane)|On-campus only|Can we fill a campus venue when students are _trapped_ locally?|
|**UCSB (Santa Barbara)**|23K|Mixed (many underclassmen without cars)|90–100 miles to Los Angeles|Local + metro hybrid|Can we dominate a local venue and also draw students to a city show with transport help?|

Below we detail each pilot market’s characteristics, the Live Nation venue strategy, and the expected learnings:

  

#### **Market 1: Ole Miss (Oxford, MS) – Memphis Arena Extension**

  

**Market Characteristics:** Oxford has ~19,000 undergrads (Ole Miss) in a town of ~28,000 total. Students make up ~68% of the local population. It’s **75 miles from Memphis** (about a 1.5-hour drive) and over 160 miles from the state capital, Jackson. Crucially, **around 95% of Ole Miss students have cars on campus** – one of the highest rates nationally – because a car is a necessity in this rural setting. Traditional media reach is abysmal: the local newspaper reaches a few thousand people; Memphis TV/radio doesn’t cover Oxford at all.

  

**Live Nation Venue Opportunity:** _FedExForum in Memphis_ (18,000+ capacity arena). Memphis is the nearest major concert city, but currently Ole Miss students are not a factor in its ticket sales due to the awareness gap. Additionally, there are smaller venues (the Orpheum Theater ~2,300 cap, etc.) that could benefit from student turnout for the right acts.

  

**Strategic Test:** Can DormWay activate Ole Miss students to become a significant part of the Memphis concert audience? If 95% have cars, lack of transportation isn’t an issue – it’s purely an awareness and motivation challenge. We will promote select Memphis shows to Ole Miss students with contextual timing (e.g., end of week, after big football games, during boredom in Oxford).

  

**Expected Learnings:**

- **Drive Rate:** What percentage of students will drive 75 miles for a major artist? Is it 2% of campus (≈380 students) for a big show? 5%? More? This determines how much a metro venue can boost sales by marketing to a college nearby.
    
- **Lead Time & Coordination:** How far in advance do we need to notify students to get carpool groups together? (We’ll experiment with promotions 1 week vs. 1 day ahead of events.)
    
- **Group Dynamics:** Do students attend in groups (carloads) and can we encourage larger group sales? (Success might prompt offering group discounts or party bus packages in the future.)
    
- **Genre & Artist Draw:** Which types of artists see the best response? Perhaps country acts (SEC school) or big-name pop/R&B? This informs what shows to cross-promote in similar college towns.
    
- **Price Sensitivity:** With a 75-mile drive, do students only go for big-name $100+ ticket concerts, or will they also bite for a $25 ticket show? Gauging the price vs. distance trade-off will help with dynamic pricing and promotion framing.
    

  

**Success Criteria:** If we can attribute on the order of 500+ tickets sold per major Memphis show to Ole Miss students (just ~2.5% of the student body), that’s significant. A < $10 CPA on those conversions would prove the model cost-effective. This pilot should demonstrate that a **75-mile radius extension is realistic** for arena shows when the marketing is done right.

  

**Replication Potential:** A successful Ole Miss→Memphis playbook can be immediately applied to similar setups:

- Auburn → Birmingham (60 miles)
    
- Tuscaloosa (Alabama) → Birmingham (60 miles)
    
- Athens (UGA) → Atlanta (70 miles)
    
- Columbia (Mizzou) → St. Louis/Kansas City (around 100 miles)
    
    And many more. We have at least 15 comparable college-to-nearby-city scenarios among the 50 targets.
    

  

#### **Market 2: Penn State (State College, PA) – On-Campus Arena & Regional City Combo**

  

**Market Characteristics:** Penn State’s University Park campus has ~42,000 undergrads (plus ~5K grad) in a town that effectively doubles in size when school is in session. It’s an isolated town: ~136 miles from Pittsburgh and ~190 miles from Philadelphia. Roughly half the students have cars (the rest rely on campus transit). The on-campus arena (Bryce Jordan Center) is large but underused for non-university events. Local media is minimal, and no big city media reaches “Happy Valley.”

  

**Live Nation Venue Opportunity:** Twofold:

- _Bryce Jordan Center (BJC)_ – ~11,000 capacity on-campus arena. It’s hosted big acts occasionally, but inconsistent turnout historically. If we can directly reach students, this venue could become a regular sellout location for medium-large tours (especially during the academic year when students are present and craving entertainment).
    
- _PPG Paints Arena, Pittsburgh_ – ~19,000 cap arena, 136 miles away. Pittsburgh is the “big city” that Penn State students might trek to a few times a year (e.g., for a huge artist not coming to campus).
    

  

**Strategic Test:**

1. **Campus Sellout Potential:** Use DormWay to pack BJC for a concert as proof that college venues can be profitable. For example, target an artist with strong college appeal and see if we can hit 10k tickets purely from campus. Timing will be key (avoid midterms/finals, perhaps right after a big football game or end of exams).
    
2. **Long-Range Draw:** Promote a major Pittsburgh show to Penn State students and see if we can drive a few hundred of them to make the 3-hour trip (maybe offering charter buses if interest is high, as an experiment).
    

  

**Expected Learnings:**

- **Fill Rate vs. Artist Tier:** Do we need a top-tier artist to fill 10k on campus, or will students show up en masse even for mid-tier acts if it’s convenient and well-timed? This informs what level of artist we target for future campus tours.
    
- **Promotion Timing:** How far in advance do we start pushing a campus show for max turnout? Colleges have unique rhythms (we’ll test an announcement at 4 weeks vs 2 weeks vs “surprise” short notice concert).
    
- **Multi-Show Dynamics:** If we promote both a campus show and a city show, is there cannibalization or complementary interest? (E.g., do the super-fans go to both, or does one satisfy their demand?)
    
- **Transport Arrangements:** For Pittsburgh, if we gauge say 200+ students interested in a concert, we might pilot a charter bus or rideshare coordination. We’ll see if providing or suggesting transportation options boosts conversion for distant shows.
    

  

**Success Criteria:** An ideal outcome is an 80%+ sold-out show at Bryce Jordan Center attributed largely to student uptake (8,000+ tickets). Even more compelling if done with minimal discounting (proving willingness to pay). For Pittsburgh, even a few hundred tickets (e.g. 300-500) from Penn State students would be a breakthrough given the distance – especially if we achieve CPA in the low teens or single digits via in-app promotion.

  

**Replication Potential:** If we crack the code here, many big state schools with on-campus arenas become viable tour stops: e.g., Virginia Tech (Cassell Coliseum ~10K), Iowa State (Hilton Coliseum ~14K), Texas A&M (Reed Arena ~13K). Plus, the idea of marketing city shows to distant campuses could apply broadly (e.g., VT students to D.C. shows, UIUC students to Chicago shows, etc.).

  

#### **Market 3: Clemson (Clemson, SC) – Regional vs. Metro Hub Strategy**

  

**Market Characteristics:** Clemson has ~23K undergrads in a classic college town (~18K permanent residents). It’s relatively remote: about 45 minutes from the midsize city of Greenville, SC (which has some venues), and ~2.5 hours from Atlanta and Charlotte (major concert cities). Car ownership is fairly high (almost half of freshmen bring cars, upperclassmen likely higher), partly because public transport is limited. Media: Clemson has no dedicated TV, and only regional radio/TV from Greenville at best. Atlanta/Charlotte media doesn’t reach them.

  

**Live Nation Venue Opportunity:**

- _Greenville – Bon Secours Wellness Arena_ (~15,000 cap) and other smaller venues in Greenville (for mid-tier shows). Clemson students could significantly boost attendance for Greenville events given the short drive.
    
- _Atlanta – State Farm Arena_ (~21,000 cap) or other Atlanta venues. Atlanta draws big tours, and Clemson students regularly travel to Atlanta for special events (sports, etc.), so the concept is to tap into that for concerts.
    

  

**Strategic Test:** Determine how distance impacts student conversion by comparing a “nearby” regional event vs. a far metro event:

- Promote one or two shows in Greenville (45 min away) to Clemson students.
    
- Promote one or two marquee shows in Atlanta (130 miles away) to Clemson students.
    
- See which gets better traction, and how messaging can mitigate the distance factor (“make a weekend of it in ATL” vs. “quick weeknight trip to Greenville”).
    

  

**Expected Learnings:**

- **Conversion vs Distance Curve:** We’ll quantify how many students we get for a 45-min drive vs. a 2.5-hour drive. This will help model expected turnout from campuses at various radii for future promotions.
    
- **Event Type Matters:** Perhaps students will go 2.5 hours for a once-in-a-year superstar tour, but not for a smaller artist. Meanwhile, a mid-level artist in Greenville might do great. Identifying what _caliber_ of event justifies longer travel for students is key for routing decisions.
    
- **Cultural Factors:** Clemson (like many southern schools) has a tradition of students driving to away football games or big weekend events – does that translate to concerts? We’ll see if school spirit or existing travel norms make them more likely to go the distance.
    
- **Carpool & Groups:** Is there organic organizing among students for the longer trip (e.g., groups of friends splitting gas)? DormWay’s carpool feature can foster this – if successful, it’s a model for other campuses where group travel can be enabled for concerts.
    

  

**Success Criteria:** If Greenville shows see, say, 300+ Clemson students (which might be 1–2% of campus) and Atlanta shows see a somewhat smaller but still notable number (100–200 students), that’s valuable data. A lower CPA for Greenville vs. a higher CPA for Atlanta is expected; the question is how much higher and is it still worthwhile (e.g., $5 CPA at 45 min vs $12 CPA at 2.5 hours might both be acceptable given ticket values).

  

**Replication Potential:** Many colleges sit around 1–3 hours from major cities. Examples: Virginia Tech (45 min to Roanoke, ~4 hrs to DC), Kansas State (~2 hrs to KC), University of Missouri (~2 hrs to St. Louis/KC). Understanding the Clemson case will guide how to handle those scenarios – whether to focus on closer regional draws or attempt the big city pull, and what support (buses, marketing angle) is needed.

  

#### **Market 4: Pullman (Washington State) – Captive Audience On-Campus**

  

**Market Characteristics:** WSU’s Pullman campus ~22K undergrads live in one of the most isolated college towns in the country. It’s **280 miles from Seattle** (~5+ hour drive) and 75 miles from the nearest city of note (Spokane). Only one-third of students have cars on campus, meaning two-thirds are basically stuck in town except on major breaks. Travel options are limited (an 8-hour bus to Seattle, infrequent flights from a small local airport). Media: effectively no local TV, minimal local radio – Pullman is a true media desert.

  

**Live Nation Venue Opportunity:**

- _Beasley Coliseum_ (on campus, ~11,600 cap). It’s mainly used for basketball and commencement, but it’s a decent concert venue that could be utilized far more. Given Pullman’s isolation, when an event _does_ come to campus, students flock to it (because there’s not much else).
    
- Possibly _Spokane Arena_ (~12,000 cap, 75 miles away) as a secondary test, but with low car ownership, expecting large numbers to travel even to Spokane is optimistic without provided transport. The focus is really on the on-campus potential.
    

  

**Strategic Test:** If ever there was a captive market that would eagerly attend on-campus entertainment, it’s Pullman. The test here is straightforward: _Can we regularly fill the on-campus venue by aligning with the academic/social calendar?_ We’ll try at least one major concert on campus, promoted heavily via DormWay, timed when students are free (e.g., right after midterms or early in the semester when they’re settled and seeking fun).

  

Additionally, we may test interest in a Spokane show – but likely by coordinating buses or group transport (e.g., if a popular artist is in Spokane on a weekend, see if we can get a couple hundred students to go, given we handle or assist with transportation).

  

**Expected Learnings:**

- **Max On-Campus Draw:** Pullman will tell us what percentage of a campus can we expect to engage when the event is right next door. Is it realistic to get 8–10K students (≈40–50% of campus) out for a big concert? That would be huge, and might exceed typical urban engagement levels, given lack of alternatives.
    
- **Booking Cadence:** How often could a campus like WSU sustain shows? Maybe the demand is so high and competition so low that you could do a concert every month. Or perhaps a couple per semester is the sweet spot. Understanding frequency limits will guide scheduling for similar captive markets.
    
- **Genre/Act Fit:** We might find that certain genres kill it on campus (e.g., rock or country might draw big in a rural school) whereas others might not. Since Pullman is a singular environment, preferences could be pronounced.
    
- **Travel Support Impact:** If we see even modest interest in Spokane events, we’ll evaluate if organizing a shuttle or partnering with Live Nation on a bus program would significantly increase that. This could set a precedent for providing transport in other low-mobility markets (for exceptional shows that are worth it).
    

  

**Success Criteria:** A sellout or near-sellout at Beasley Coliseum would be a home run – proving that an isolated campus can indeed be a tour stop with proper marketing. Even hitting 8–9K attendance (75–80% capacity) for a mid-tier artist would be very promising. CPA should be extremely low here (we’d expect <$6) given how captive and concentrated the audience is. For Spokane, if we manage to send a full bus or two of students (100+ people) for a show, that’s a notable win under the circumstances.

  

**Replication Potential:** Other highly isolated campuses akin to Pullman include University of Idaho (next door to WSU, could be tied in), University of Montana (Missoula), University of Maine (Orono), and to some extent places like West Virginia University (Morgantown – not as far, but still isolated regionally). If the “captive campus” strategy works at WSU, it can work at these schools – turning them into reliable tour stops when tours might otherwise skip them.

  

#### **Market 5: UC Santa Barbara – Local/Metro Hybrid Strategy**

  

**Market Characteristics:** UCSB has ~23K undergrads located in Isla Vista (an almost entirely student community) adjacent to Santa Barbara, CA. Santa Barbara is a unique case: it’s 90+ miles from Los Angeles, so outside the LA media market, yet it’s a desirable area with its own smaller population and tourism. Many underclassmen at UCSB do not have cars (freshmen can’t park on campus easily), but juniors/seniors often do. Crucially, **billboards are banned** in the county and the city strictly limits signage, so mass advertising is minimal. There’s a regional airport and Amtrak, but day-to-day, students without cars don’t go to LA often.

  

**Live Nation Venue Opportunity:**

- _Santa Barbara Bowl_ – a gorgeous 4,500-seat outdoor amphitheater. It hosts a number of concerts, but many students don’t engage due to lack of targeted marketing (audience tends to skew local/non-student currently). With UCSB students comprising a huge portion of the community, capturing even half of them would fill this venue.
    
- _Los Angeles venues_ – e.g., The Forum (17K), Hollywood Bowl (17K), Greek Theatre (5.9K), etc. LA gets every major tour. If we can mobilize even a small percentage of UCSB students for big shows, that’s gravy (especially for weekend events when a train or carpool can be fun).
    

  

**Strategic Test:**

- **Local Venue Domination:** Use DormWay to turn Santa Barbara Bowl concerts into predominantly student-attended events. By aligning promotions with campus interest (and possibly tying into UCSB events like welcome week or graduation week), we aim to dramatically increase student ticket share for shows at the Bowl.
    
- **Metro Tie-In:** Also promote a handful of high-profile LA concerts to UCSB students, while highlighting transportation options (Amtrak schedule, student-organized coach bus, etc.). See if we can capture those who crave bigger city experiences occasionally.
    

  

**Expected Learnings:**

- **Venue Takeover Rate:** What portion of a 4,500-seat venue can we realistically fill with students if we focus on them? 50% (2,250 students) would be outstanding and would fundamentally change how promoters view that venue.
    
- **Impact of Advertising Void:** Santa Barbara is a test of “if DormWay doesn’t tell them, they won’t know.” We suspect engagement will be high because we’re basically the only game in town for awareness. This will highlight DormWay’s value in markets with heavy ad restrictions or where traditional advertising literally can’t go.
    
- **Travel vs. Local Preference:** Do UCSB students prefer to stay local even if the act is smaller, or will they travel to LA for a huge act instead of a moderate local one? This will inform whether to primarily book more shows at SB Bowl or simply use SB as a feeder for LA shows (or both, alternating).
    
- **Transportation Facilitation:** If we promote an LA show, how many students would go if, say, a party bus is available vs. not? We might partner with student groups or a bus company for one trial to measure this. The findings will guide future integration of transit solutions into the app for long-distance event travel.
    

  

**Success Criteria:** For Santa Barbara Bowl, attributing 2,000+ student ticket purchases (≈45–50% of capacity) to DormWay would demonstrate we can effectively flip the audience makeup. CPA might be a bit higher here due to the mix of local and travel messaging, but we target <$12. For LA shows, even pulling 300–500 students per major concert (with some group travel coordination) would be eye-opening, given those are attendees who likely would not have gone on their own.

  

**Replication Potential:** The UCSB scenario mirrors other “college town near a big city” cases: e.g., UC Davis (near Sacramento and not far from SF), Rutgers (near NYC/Philly), University of New Hampshire (near Boston). Also, any place with strict local ad rules (many college towns have limits on campus advertising) could benefit from DormWay similarly.

### **III. Venue Strategy Matrix – What We’ll Learn**

  

After 3 months of pilot data, Live Nation will have concrete answers to critical questions in each scenario – effectively a playbook for each type of market. Here’s what we aim to validate:

  

**Campus Venue Economics** (Pilot: Penn State, Pullman):

- What % of a student body can we convert into attendees for an on-campus concert with direct marketing? (10%, 20%…more?)
    
- Does extreme isolation (Pullman) yield higher uptake than a semi-isolated campus (Penn State), or just about the same?
    
- What caliber of artist or production is needed to fill a campus arena – can an emerging artist sell 10K tickets at the right campus, or do we need A-listers?
    
- How frequently could we repeat shows at the same campus before saturating interest (every month vs. once a semester)?
    

  

_Business Impact:_ If we prove that even mid-tier artists can draw thousands on campus, Live Nation can confidently add college venues to tour routings knowing they won’t flop. This opens up new revenue (and artist exposure) opportunities with low risk.

  

**Local Venue Domination** (Pilot: UCSB – Santa Barbara Bowl):

- Can a targeted campaign make college students the majority audience for a local venue event?
    
- Does boosting student attendance at a local venue cannibalize or enhance attendance at nearby metro shows (i.e., will those students now skip LA shows or does it whet their appetite for more)?
    
- Which genres work best for an all-student push in a smaller venue? Perhaps indie and alternative acts resonate on college campuses more than in general markets, for example.
    

  

_Business Impact:_ If we demonstrate that a 3–5K venue in a college town can be reliably filled via DormWay, Live Nation could proactively route more tours (especially developing acts and mid-level tours) through these venues. It also strengthens relationships with those venue partners as Live Nation becomes the one who can deliver crowds.

  

**Metro Arena Extension** (Pilot: Ole Miss/Memphis and UCSB/LA):

- How far out can we extend a major arena’s draw with college marketing? We’ll gauge what % of an arena’s tickets can come from an otherwise untapped college 60, 90, 130 miles away.
    
- What is the ROI of targeting those students? E.g., if 500 Ole Miss students come to FedExForum, that might represent $30K in revenue for that show – was it achieved at a reasonable marketing cost and effort?
    
- Are there diminishing returns beyond a certain distance or travel time? Maybe 2 hours is the cutoff for meaningful numbers, or perhaps certain big events break the rule.
    

  

_Business Impact:_ Armed with this info, Live Nation marketing teams can extend their outreach for major shows to include college towns in that 50–100 mile band that are currently ignored. Essentially, it adds a whole new layer to your marketing maps for arena tours, potentially boosting sales and attendance in markets that might otherwise struggle to sell out.

  

**Regional Hub Optimization** (Pilot: Clemson – Greenville/Atlanta):

- How do we best allocate marketing between a nearby secondary market and a farther primary market? If Clemson shows strong preference for Greenville shows vs. Atlanta, that suggests focusing efforts on the closer hub for similar campuses.
    
- Does providing or suggesting transportation dramatically improve turnout for the farther option? If our data says 100 were interested in Atlanta but only 50 went until we offered a bus, that’s significant insight.
    
- Are there scenarios where a student will choose one event over another due to timing? (E.g., they skip a Friday night local show because they plan to drive to a Saturday big show in the city.) Understanding these choices will help schedule regional tours without cannibalizing your own audiences.
    

  

_Business Impact:_ Live Nation can refine how it staggers and markets regional tour dates. For instance, if an artist is playing both Greenville and Atlanta, you might not bother marketing the Atlanta date to Clemson if we learn they’ll just go to Greenville two weeks later – or vice versa if they prefer the big city experience. Optimizing this prevents “wasted” marketing overlap and maximizes total attendance across the region.

  

**Decision Framework for National Rollout:**

Based on what the pilot confirms, we will categorize the remaining 45 target markets for staged rollout:

- **Campus Venue Priority Markets:** If pilots show campus shows can thrive, then any market with a big on-campus venue (and large student body) becomes a top priority for activation. _Expected: ~15 campuses._ We focus DormWay marketing there on filling those campus venues first and foremost.
    
- **Metro Extension Markets:** If driving 60–100 miles proves effective, then for each major Live Nation arena we identify the nearest big campus markets just outside the current reach. _Expected: ~20 campuses._ We set up pipelines from those colleges to the city venues (possibly coordinating special student sections, transport, etc., as part of the offering).
    
- **Local Venue Markets:** If we can own the 3–5K venues, then any college town with a decent local venue and high student ratio is next. _Expected: ~10 campuses._ We partner with or utilize those venues for targeted college programming (could even include working with talent scouts for up-and-coming artists to hit those spots).
    
- **Hybrid/Custom Cases:** A few places might need a mixed approach (e.g., a campus that’s semi-isolated but also within bus distance of a city). _Expected: ~5 campuses._ We’ll apply a tailored mix of tactics learned.
    

  

This decision matrix ensures we tackle the biggest wins first and use resources efficiently as we scale up to all 50 and beyond.

### **IV. Operational Requirements**

  

#### **Dashboard & Data Sharing for Live Nation**

  

To make this partnership seamless, DormWay will provide a real-time analytics dashboard accessible to Live Nation’s teams. Key features and data points include:

- **Demand Signals:** Early indicators like “X% of students are showing interest in [Artist]’s show.” This includes data like how many students clicked “Interested” on a promoted event, how many shared it with friends, etc. We’ll surface contextual signals too (e.g., “Thousands of students will finish midterms this Wednesday – expect a spike in interest for weekend events”).
    
- **Performance Tracking:** Live tracking of click-through rates, ticket conversions, and funnel drop-off. For each show/campus we promote, you can see: suggestions delivered → students who engaged → tickets purchased (and we can even integrate purchase data to verify exact numbers). This transparency lets you measure ROI instantly.
    
- **Optimization Tools:** Ability to A/B test different messages or creatives for an event promotion, control the timing (send a push at 4pm vs 8pm, for example), and segment by subgroups (seniors vs freshmen, or greek life vs general population if relevant). The dashboard will highlight if, say, a certain message drove more clicks at Clemson while another worked better at Ole Miss, helping refine best practices per region.
    

  

Additionally, we will share aggregated insights regularly:

- **Heatmaps** of where interest is spiking (maybe one week we see Texas schools surge in interest for country acts, etc.).
    
- **Genre popularity charts** by region.
    
- **Academic calendar overlays** – see upcoming periods (breaks, exams) when engagement might dip or spike, so we can plan promotions accordingly.
    

  

This data isn’t just for marketing – Live Nation’s booking and tour planning teams can utilize it to make evidence-based decisions about where and when to schedule shows.

  

#### **Transportation Coordination Features**

  

One key to unlocking college markets (especially for off-campus events) is solving the transportation hurdle. DormWay will incorporate features to facilitate this, working hand-in-hand with Live Nation when needed:

- **Built-In Carpool Matching:** Within the app, when a student views an event that’s out of town, they’ll see options to find others going. DormWay can match students for carpooling to concerts – helping them split gas and ride together. (This not only helps attendance but makes the event more of a social experience from the start.)
    
- **Interest-Triggered Shuttles:** We will monitor when a critical mass of students show interest in a distant event. For example, if 200+ UCSB students want to attend a LA concert, the app can prompt: “Should we arrange a bus from campus to the venue?” If enough say yes, we’ll work with Live Nation’s local venue team or third-party providers to set that up (or at least inform LN that there’s demand to justify a shuttle service).
    
- **Logistics Info & Reminders:** DormWay will provide tailored info like driving directions, parking details at the venue (and even offer prepaid parking passes when possible), and train/bus schedules for those without cars – all within the event listing. Essentially, we reduce the friction of attending off-campus shows.
    
- **Group Ticketing Integration:** As we see groups forming, we can integrate with Live Nation’s ticketing to suggest group deals or seat bundle offers (if available) – for instance, “Buy 4 tickets together and get a discount” right when a carpool of 4 is being arranged.
    

  

**Live Nation’s Role:** We’d love LN’s venue operations to collaborate by:

- Identifying safe pickup/dropoff spots for campus shuttles or party buses (and possibly co-sponsoring those for big events if the demand is clear).
    
- Providing special student parking rates or reserved sections if possible (e.g., “UCLA student section” at a Staples Center event if a lot of UCLA folks are coming, which could encourage more to join).
    
- Being flexible with group sales or promo codes for student groups we send their way, to sweeten the deal.
    

  

These logistical supports amplify the impact of our marketing by removing barriers that might otherwise prevent a willing student from actually converting into an attendee.

### **V. Financial Projections**

  

#### **Pilot Program Economics (Q1 2026, 3-month pilot)**

  

**Live Nation Investment:** $0 for the pilot period (DormWay is covering costs as part of proving out the partnership value).

  

**Anticipated Ticket Uplift (attributed to DormWay promotions):**

- _Ole Miss → Memphis:_ ~500–800 additional tickets sold across 3–4 major shows (assuming 150–200 students per show for a few big concerts).
    
- _Penn State (Campus & Pittsburgh):_ ~8,000–10,000 tickets for an on-campus show (essentially selling out or nearly so for one concert), plus an extra ~300+ tickets for a Pittsburgh show from student attendees.
    
- _Clemson → Greenville/Atlanta:_ ~600–900 tickets total; e.g., 300 for a Greenville show, 300 for an Atlanta show, spread over a few events.
    
- _Pullman (WSU campus):_ ~9,000–11,000 tickets for one large on-campus concert (i.e., effectively filling the arena with mostly students).
    
- _UCSB → SB Bowl + LA:_ ~2,500 student tickets at Santa Barbara Bowl (over a couple of shows) plus perhaps ~400 students traveling to various LA concerts in that timeframe.
    

  

That’s roughly **21,000–24,000 tickets** directly attributable to DormWay pilot campaigns in 3 months.

  

**Marketing Efficiency:** We aim for an average CPA <$12 during the pilot. Some highly captive scenarios (Pullman) might be as low as $5, others like getting students to LA might be closer to $12–$15. Even at the high end, this beats the traditional $25+ CPA by a wide margin, especially since we can track every conversion.

  

**Pilot Success Criteria:** If we confirm a CPA in the ~$10 range (or better) and can show clear attribution for those ~20K ticket sales, the pilot will be deemed a success. At that point, scaling up is an obvious next step given the positive ROI.

  

#### **Year 1 Rollout (Full 50 College Towns)**

  

If Live Nation commits to the first 50 campuses for Year 1 (2026), here are ballpark projections:

  

**Projected Tickets Sold (Year 1 via DormWay):**

- _Campus venue shows:_ ~150,000 tickets (assumes ~15 big campus shows averaging ~10K each – some campuses might do two shows in a year, some one).
    
- _Metro venue extensions:_ ~80,000 tickets (from promoting major city tours to students in ~20 nearby college markets, averaging perhaps 4K additional attendees per metro area across multiple events).
    
- _Local venue fills:_ ~50,000 tickets (across ~10 smaller venues in college towns, averaging a few full houses each).
    

  

Total **~280,000 tickets** influenced by DormWay in year one.

  

**Revenue Impact:**

- At an average ticket price of ~$60, that’s roughly **$16.8 million** in gross ticket sales generated.
    
- Live Nation’s promoter share (estimated ~15% of gross, though it could be higher when LN is also the venue/operator) would be about **$2.5 million**. There are also ancillary revenue streams (concessions, fees, future sales from repeat customers, etc. not counted here).
    
- Partnership Cost: If LN chooses a robust plan (let’s say towards the higher end, $4–5M for the year), compare that with the $2.5M in direct fees – it suggests the program nearly pays for itself in pure Year 1 dollars, even before considering the long-term value of new fan relationships and data gained. If a more modest plan is chosen (~$1.5–$3M range), the direct revenue easily exceeds cost.
    
- **Intangible Benefits:** In addition to revenue, by Year 1’s end you’d have tangible case studies of full houses in formerly dark markets, thousands of new customer sign-ups (we can feed student buyer info into your CRM for future marketing), and a trove of data about what works where.
    

  

In summary, Year 1 is about breaking even _at worst_ on the direct economics (and likely doing better), while setting the stage for explosive ROI in subsequent years.

  

_(Note: These are conservative projections – if some markets really catch fire, the numbers could be higher. Also, as the platform grows, DormWay’s per-ticket marketing cost might further decrease with scale.)_

### **VI. Risk Mitigation**

  

Launching a new partnership and platform at this scale comes with some risks. We have thought through key risks and our plans to mitigate them:

- **Risk: Students might not adopt DormWay as predicted, limiting our reach.**
    
    **Mitigation:** DormWay’s core utility (academic tools) drives adoption – our University of Michigan pilot hit ~47K users, essentially the whole campus. We’re launching with integration to systems students already use (LMS, email) to ensure we gain traction. Still, we will monitor adoption at each campus. If uptake is slower somewhere, we can ramp up grassroots marketing (orientation events, ambassadors) or adjust features. The key is we’re not relying on entertainment content alone to attract users – it’s the daily academic help that gets them on board, which we’ve proven works.
    
- **Risk: In low car-ownership markets, students still won’t travel to shows even if they know about them.**
    
    **Mitigation:** That’s why our strategy emphasizes **on-campus events** for places like Pullman and focuses on local venues first. For travel-dependent scenarios, we plan to actively assist with transportation (as described above). If, despite that, a particular campus doesn’t generate off-campus travelers, we simply pivot to only doing on-campus or very local events there. The mix of strategies (campus vs city) will be tailored by what the data tells us for each school.
    
- **Risk: Local venue or campus administrators are skeptical or resistant (e.g., concern about too many concerts, or marketing on campus).**
    
    **Mitigation:** We have initial buy-in at pilot campuses and we’ll leverage the pilot success data to approach other campuses with proof. Also, because DormWay adds _academic_ value, universities are less likely to view it as just a marketing channel – we’re often welcomed by administrators for the utility we provide, easing access. And since Live Nation has relationships with many campus venues (through sports or prior events), we can coordinate together on smoothing any operational hurdles.
    
- **Risk: Artists or tour managers aren’t convinced to include college stops.**
    
    **Mitigation:** We expect that having concrete sell-out data from pilots (e.g., “look, WSU sold 10k tickets in 2 days via DormWay”) will change minds. However, as a fallback, we can focus initial college venue shows on artists who are eager for exposure or extra dates (emerging artists, or big names during “off” nights between major city gigs). DormWay’s value to artist development can be emphasized – showing that college shows build future fanbases. Over time, as we rack up wins, more agents will request campus dates once they see the profitability.
    
- **Risk: The partnership doesn’t deliver ROI for Live Nation in some markets.**
    
    **Mitigation:** We start with a low-risk pilot and **no cost** trial precisely to prove the ROI before any big commitment. We’ll measure everything and be very transparent. If certain markets underperform, we’ll investigate why and either adjust strategy or reallocate resources to better markets. The tiered approach means you’re not locked into an all-or-nothing — we can scale up in the areas working best and trim or tweak those that lag. We are as invested in demonstrating success as you are, since it’s our platform’s reputation on the line too.
    

  

By anticipating these concerns, we are confident we can address them head-on. The pilot structure ensures we learn and adapt quickly with minimal downside risk.

### **VII. Conclusion and Next Steps**

  

**Strategic Recommendation:** Live Nation should seize this opportunity to become the exclusive launch partner with Campus Connect (DormWay) because it offers a rare combination of **zero-risk validation** and massive upside. Specifically, this partnership will allow Live Nation to:

- **Validate** new marketing and venue strategies in a controlled environment (college towns) without upfront cost, turning previously unreachable markets into measurable successes.
    
- **Prove** that targeted digital outreach can drive ticket sales where traditional methods failed – ending the guesswork for college demographics.
    
- **Extend** the revenue footprint of existing tours and venues by bringing in audiences from 50 new markets, effectively expanding the reach of your shows without adding major cost.
    
- **Build** a long-term data advantage and pipeline of young loyal customers that will fuel your business for the next decade.
    

  

DormWay is prepared to execute quickly and collaboratively. Our interests are aligned: we only succeed if we make your concerts succeed in these markets.

  

**Immediate Action Items:**

1. **Finalize Partnership Agreement (Week 1–2):** Define the scope of the pilot (which venues, which upcoming shows to promote in Jan–Mar 2026), and establish data-sharing and communications protocols. Our team will coordinate with yours to get the tech integration and legal details sorted out swiftly.
    
2. **Pilot Launch (Months 1–2 of partnership):** Roll out DormWay promotions in the five pilot markets as detailed. Monitor jointly via the dashboard and weekly check-ins. Tweak messaging or timing as needed in real-time. Live Nation teams should start seeing student engagement feedback almost immediately once we launch (e.g., surges in ticket page hits from those areas).
    
3. **Mid-Pilot Review (end of Month 1):** Quick interim report on how each pilot market is trending (early ticket sales, app engagement levels). Address any issues (for example, if one market is lagging, decide if any extra push or a different approach is needed).
    
4. **Final Pilot Analysis & Decision (Month 3):** At the conclusion of the pilot period, DormWay will deliver a full performance report: tickets sold by market/event, CPA achieved, qualitative student feedback, etc. We’ll meet with Live Nation stakeholders to evaluate ROI against targets. If outcomes are positive (we fully expect they will be), we green-light the broader rollout.
    
5. **Plan Expansion (Starting Q2 2026):** Prioritize which markets to tackle next (likely all Tier 1, some Tier 2 as discussed). Set the timeline for onboarding those campuses (the beauty is, technically the platform will already be live at all schools; it’s mainly deciding where to focus promotions first). Also, begin incorporating any pilot learnings into improved tactics for the expansion phase.
    
6. **Scale & Innovate (Q3 2026 onward):** Continue adding markets until all 50 are active. Meanwhile, gather feedback for potential new features (maybe deeper social sharing for events, or loyalty rewards for student attendees – lots of possibilities). Live Nation will be our co-innovation partner: if there’s a feature that could further enhance student concert-going (and thus your sales), we want to build it.
    

  

In conclusion, DormWay’s Campus Connect platform offers Live Nation a chance to unlock a **new growth engine** – the college demographic – through a partnership that starts with evidence and ends with nationwide dominance. By acting now, Live Nation will secure an early-mover advantage that not only drives short-term sales in overlooked markets but also cements a **strategic moat** around the next generation of live event consumers.

  

We’re excited to potentially embark on this journey together. **Let’s transform college town entertainment and set the foundation for Live Nation’s future fan base.**

## Dynamic Campaign Assignment

```javascript
// Determine which campaign track based on behavior
function assignOnboardingCampaign(user: User): CampaignTrack {
  const profile = analyzeOnboardingBehavior(user);
  
  if (profile.completionTime < 300 && profile.allPermissionsGranted) {
    return 'power_user_fast_track';
  }
  
  if (profile.completionTime > 1200 && profile.permissionResearch) {
    return 'trust_education_track';
  }
  
  if (!profile.notificationPermission && !profile.calendarPermission) {
    return 'permission_education_track';
  }
  
  if (!profile.profileComplete) {
    return profile.timeElapsed < 3600 ? 'aggressive_recovery' : 'gentle_recovery';
  }
  
  if (profile.supportContacts > 0 || profile.tosRead) {
    return 'high_touch_support_track';
  }
  
  if (profile.daysToFullAdoption > 7) {
    return 'patient_nurturing_track';
  }
  
  return 'standard_onboarding_track';
}
```

## A/B Testing Strategy

### Test 1: Permission Priming
- **Variant A**: Ask immediately after profile
- **Variant B**: Wait until feature context
- **Variant C**: Education before asking
- **Metric**: Permission grant rate

### Test 2: Recovery Messaging
- **Variant A**: Urgency-based ("Don't miss out")
- **Variant B**: Empathy-based ("We understand")
- **Variant C**: Peer-based ("Join your classmates")
- **Metric**: Recovery rate

### Test 3: Email Frequency
- **Variant A**: Daily for first week
- **Variant B**: Every other day
- **Variant C**: Day 1, 3, 7 only
- **Metric**: Engagement vs unsubscribe

## Special Scenarios

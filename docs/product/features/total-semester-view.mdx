# Total Semester View

**Status**: 🟡 Design Phase  
**Priority**: High - Marquee Feature  
**Dependencies**: BrainGains, Calendar Connection, Syllabus Upload  
**Created**: 2025-07-19  

## Overview

The Total Semester View is a comprehensive AI-powered analysis that provides students with a complete understanding of their entire semester - workload distribution, peak stress periods, study recommendations, and strategic planning insights. This marquee feature requires students to feed Ace/BrainGains their syllabi and connect their calendar to generate insights.

## Core Concept

### What It Is
- A holistic, AI-generated analysis of the entire semester's academic landscape
- Dynamic visualization of workload distribution across weeks
- Predictive insights about challenging periods and resource allocation
- Personalized study strategies based on course requirements
- Real-time updates as the semester progresses

### What It's Not
- Not just a calendar view or assignment list
- Not a simple aggregation of due dates
- Not a static analysis - it evolves throughout the semester

## Open Questions

1. How to handle courses without uploaded syllabi?
2. Should we integrate with Canvas/Blackboard for auto-updates?
3. How much historical data to show after semester progresses?
4. Privacy considerations for aggregated insights?
5. How to handle schedule changes mid-semester?
6. **How to enable users to set up future semesters?** → See [Semester Term Management](/docs/product/features/semester-term-management)

## Dependencies

### Critical Dependency: [Semester Term Management](/docs/product/features/semester-term-management)
The Total Semester View requires proper semester/term management to:
- Know which term the user is viewing/planning
- Support "upcoming semester" setup before current term ends
- Archive and compare historical semester data
- Handle term transitions gracefully

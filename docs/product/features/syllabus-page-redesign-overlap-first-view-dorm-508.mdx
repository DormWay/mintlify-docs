# Syllabus Page Redesign - Overlap-First View (DORM-508)

**Status:** In Progress
**Priority:** High
**Assignee:** Ethan Kaplan
**Linear Issue:** [DORM-508](https://linear.app/dormwayllc/issue/DORM-508)
**Created:** 2025-11-01
**Branch:** `feat/dorm-508-syllabus-overlap-view`

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The current syllabus page is overwhelming and not student-focused:
- ❌ Too much technical information (processing details, AI metadata)
- ❌ Unclear value proposition - students don't know what to DO
- ❌ Data accuracy issues (e.g., "1 on Sunday" weekly distribution)
- ❌ Critical overlaps are hard to spot - requires mental correlation across sections
- ❌ "Course Command Center" takes space without showing overlaps

**Key Insight:** Students need to quickly identify **when things overlap** and **what to do about it**.

---

## 🌟 Solution Overview

**Redesign the "Your Term" view to be overlap-first:**

1. **Collision Report Cards** - Immediate, actionable view of critical overlap periods
2. **Swimlane Timeline** - Visual exploration showing all courses and overlaps at a glance
3. **Enhanced Workload Chart** - Keep existing chart, add overlap markers
4. **Collapsed Details** - Technical analysis available on-demand

**Design Philosophy:**
- Show the problem (overlaps) first
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Make it visual and scannable
- Work great on mobile (future React Native app)

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Phase 1: Data Layer (6 hours)**

**New Hook:** `useOverlapAnalysis.ts`

**Purpose:** Aggregate and analyze all deadlines to detect overlap periods.

**Key Data Structures:**

```typescript
interface OverlapPeriod {
  weekKey: string;          // "2025-W45"
  weekStart: string;        // ISO date
  weekEnd: string;
  weekLabel: string;        // "Nov 4-10"
  intensity: number;        // 1-10 scale
  totalEstimatedHours: number;
  overlapCount: number;     // Number of items on same day

  assignments: Assignment[];
  exams: Assignment[];

  // Critical days (3+ items)
  criticalDays: {
    date: string;
    dayLabel: string;
    items: Assignment[];
    totalHours: number;
  }[];

  affectedCourses: {
    courseId: string;
    courseName: string;
    itemCount: number;
  }[];

  recommendations: {
    type: 'start_early' | 'request_extension' | 'block_time';
    priority: 'high' | 'medium' | 'low';
    action: string;
  }[];

  severity: 'critical' | 'high' | 'moderate' | 'low';
}
```

**Algorithm:**

1. Group all assignments by week
2. Identify weeks with 2+ major items (exams, papers, projects)
3. Calculate intensity score based on:
   - Total estimated hours
   - Number of exams
   - Same-day conflicts
4. Generate AI recommendations:
   - Start early for exam-heavy weeks
   - Block study time before critical days
   - Suggest extensions when papers overlap with exams
5. Classify severity and sort by criticality

**Data Sources:**
- `summary.weekly_cadence` - Workload per week
- `summary.conflictAnalysis.conflicts` - Detected conflicts
- `summary.course_assignments` - All assignments from Canvas/syllabi
- `syllabusCourses` - Course syllabus data
- `flattenedAssignments` - Collected from `collectCourseAssignments()`

### **Phase 2: Collision Report Cards (8 hours)**

**Component:** `CollisionReportSection.tsx`

**Features:**
- Card-based layout (1-3 most critical periods)
- Expandable/collapsible details
- Color-coded by severity (red = critical, orange = high, yellow = moderate)
- Action buttons (Add to Calendar, Set Reminders)
- Responsive (stacks on mobile)

**Visual Elements:**
- Severity badge (🔥 CRITICAL, ⚠️ HIGH, ⚡ MODERATE)
- Icon indicators (⚡ exam, 📄 paper, 🎯 project)
- Progress indicators
- Gradient backgrounds based on severity
- Glowing effects for critical periods

### **Phase 3: Swimlane Timeline (16 hours)**

**Component:** `SwimlaneTimelineView.tsx`

**Desktop Features:**
- Horizontal scrolling timeline (next 16 weeks)
- Vertical swimlanes (one per course)
- Color-coded course indicators (unique hue per course)
- Assignment icons in cells (⚡🧪📄🎯)
- Overlap detection (red border when 2+ items same day)
- Click assignment → Detail modal
- Navigation controls (prev/next week)

**Mobile Features:**
- Compact week-by-week view
- Swipe gestures to navigate
- Tap to expand timeline
- Touch-optimized hit targets
- Simplified layout for small screens

**Technical Challenges:**
- Performance optimization for 100+ assignments
- Smooth scrolling with many DOM elements
- Responsive breakpoints
- Touch gesture handling
- Timezone-aware date calculations

### **Phase 4: Mobile Optimizations (6 hours)**

**Responsive Design:**
- Desktop (> 768px): Full swimlane timeline
- Tablet (768-1024px): Condensed timeline with horizontal scroll
- Mobile (< 768px): Stacked week cards with expand/collapse

**Touch Interactions:**
- Horizontal swipe = Navigate weeks
- Tap assignment = Show details modal
- Long press = Quick actions menu
- Pinch zoom = Adjust timeline density

### **Phase 5: Integration (6 hours)**

**Modified Files:**
- `SyllabusTermView.tsx` - Main integration point
- `SyllabusCoursesView.tsx` - Keep for reference (move to tab)
- `WeeklyWorkloadChart.tsx` - Add overlap markers

**New Files:**
- `hooks/useOverlapAnalysis.ts` - Data layer
- `components/syllabus/CollisionReportSection.tsx` - Cards
- `components/syllabus/SwimlaneTimelineView.tsx` - Timeline
- `components/syllabus/AlertBanner.tsx` - Top alert

### **Phase 6: Testing & Refinement (6 hours)**

**Test Scenarios:**
- No overlaps (empty state)
- 1 critical period
- Multiple critical periods (5+)
- Mobile vs desktop rendering
- Timezone edge cases
- Missing data (no estimated hours, no syllabus)
- Performance with 50+ courses

**Edge Cases:**
- Weeks with no assignments
- Same-day conflicts (5+ items)
- Multi-day assignments (projects)
- Break weeks
- Timezone boundaries

## 📱 Mobile App Considerations

**React Native Implementation:**
- Create separate `MobileSwimlaneTimeline.tsx` using React Native components
- Use `react-native-gesture-handler` for swipe gestures
- Use `react-native-reanimated` for smooth animations
- Optimize for touch targets (44x44 minimum)
- Support both iOS and Android
- Offline mode (cache overlap analysis)

**Native Features:**
- Local notifications for critical periods
- Calendar integration (iOS/Android)
- Share timeline screenshot
- Widget showing next critical period

---

## 🎯 Success Metrics

**Post-Implementation:**
- ✅ Students can identify next critical period in < 5 seconds
- ✅ No "1 on Sunday" data anomalies (validation layer)
- ✅ Overlaps visually clear without reading text
- ✅ Mobile experience on par with desktop
- ✅ Recommendations are actionable and specific

**User Feedback Targets:**
- "This helped me plan my studying" - 80%+ positive
- Reduced support tickets about deadline confusion
- Increased engagement with syllabus features

---

## 🚧 Known Limitations

1. **AI Recommendations:** Initial implementation uses rule-based logic (not LLM)
2. **Calendar Integration:** Add to Calendar feature requires backend support
3. **Estimation Accuracy:** Relies on AI-extracted hours from syllabi (may be inaccurate)
4. **Historical Data:** Only shows future overlaps (past deadlines hidden)

## 🐛 Phase 3 Bug Fixes (2025-11-02)

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. Temporal Context Not Passing to Cross-Course Insights ✅

**Problem:** CURRENT_WEEK, TOTAL_WEEKS, WEEKS_REMAINING variables were empty in Portkey prompt pp-cross-cour-51ca51.

**Root Cause:** Workflow wasn't passing `term_dates` to `runCrossCourseLearning` activity (line 522).

**Fix:**
- Updated workflow (lines 522-528) to spread `term_dates` into activity call
- Updated activity (lines 1502-1503) to support both field formats: `start`/`end` AND `start_date`/`end_date`

**Impact:**
- Temporal context now calculated correctly using `new Date()` grounded in today's date
- Portkey prompt receives week-based semester progress for time-aware recommendations

**Files Changed:**
- `services/engine/src/workflows/semesterProcessor.workflow.ts` (lines 522-528)
- `services/engine/src/activities/semester.activities.ts` (lines 1498-1538)

#### 2. Term Dates Never Populated ✅

**Problem:** Even after fix #1, logs showed `"No term dates available for temporal context"` because `resolveCurrentTermForStudent` was only called when term/year were NOT provided.

**Root Cause:** Workflow line 132 conditional only called resolver when `!termProvided || !yearProvided`. When user explicitly passed `term="Fall"` and `year=2025`, function was skipped entirely.

**Fix:**
- Changed workflow (lines 132-163) to ALWAYS call `resolveCurrentTermForStudent`
- Only override term/year if not explicitly provided
- ALWAYS set `term_dates` for temporal context regardless of whether term/year were provided
- Extract from `campus_configs.academic_calendar.terms`

**Impact:**
- Term dates now consistently fetched from academic calendar
- Temporal context calculation works for both explicit and implicit term/year parameters

**Files Changed:**
- `services/engine/src/workflows/semesterProcessor.workflow.ts` (lines 132-163)

#### 3. Semester Planning Data Not Displaying ✅

**Problem:** Latest run (01:48:48) had risk management data in database but wasn't showing in UI. Habit formation and milestone calendar were also missing.

**Root Cause:** Portkey prompt structure changed to nest data under `success_framework` and `semester_strategy`:
- `success_framework.habit_formation` (5 entries)
- `success_framework.milestone_calendar` (6 entries)
- `semester_strategy.contingency_plans`

UI was looking for these at the top level.

**Fix:**
- Updated `useSemesterAggregate` hook (lines 113-125) to extract nested data
- Added fallback extraction logic to support both nested and top-level structures
- Extracts from `dataSummary?.success_framework` and `dataSummary?.semester_strategy`

**Impact:**
- Habit formation, milestone calendar, and contingency plans now display correctly
- Hook gracefully handles both old and new Portkey prompt structures

**Files Changed:**
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/hooks/useSemesterAggregate.ts` (lines 113-125)

### Data Quality Improvements

**With Gemini Thinking Mode OFF:**

**Semester Planning** (pp-semester-p-190a90):
- ✅ 5 risk management entries with linked courses and mitigation strategies
- ✅ 5 habit formation entries with implementation weeks and measurement criteria
- ✅ 6 milestone calendar entries with success criteria
- ✅ Detailed contingency plans with trigger conditions
- ✅ Semester strategy phases with weekly focus areas

**Workload Analysis** (pp-semester-w-6ea66d):
- ✅ 4 peak weeks identified:
  - Week of Oct 6: Intensity 90 (3 midterms)
  - Week of Oct 27: Intensity 80 (2 quizzes + Executive Brief)
  - Week of Nov 3: Intensity 80 (Chem midterm + Book Analysis)
  - Week of Dec 1: Intensity 80 (Finals prep begins)
- ✅ 2 resource conflicts (mental_energy, time) across peak weeks
- ✅ 1 sustained high-intensity period (Oct 6 - Nov 10, intensity 8)
- ✅ Weekly analysis with real assignment hours (not generic placeholders)
- ✅ Stress alerts for each peak week with mitigation strategies

### Related Issues Created

- **DORM-512**: Handle Gemini thinking mode responses in Portkey parser
  - Gemini 2.5 thinking mode returns multi-part responses with `"thought": true` parts
  - Parser needs to filter out thought parts and extract only the actual JSON response
  - Temporary workaround: Disabled thinking mode in Portkey prompts
  - Proper fix will be implemented in DORM-512

### Technical Details

**Temporal Context Calculation Logic:**
```typescript
const now = new Date();  // Ground in today's date
const termStart = new Date(startDate);
const termEnd = new Date(endDate);
const totalMs = termEnd.getTime() - termStart.getTime();
const elapsedMs = now.getTime() - termStart.getTime();
const weeksElapsed = Math.max(0, Math.floor(elapsedMs / (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)));
const totalWeeks = Math.max(1, Math.ceil(totalMs / (7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000)));
const currentWeek = Math.min(weeksElapsed + 1, totalWeeks); // 1-indexed
```

**Data Structure Mapping:**
```typescript
// OLD (expected at top level)
summary.habit_formation
summary.milestone_calendar
summary.contingency_plans

// NEW (nested under success_framework/semester_strategy)
dataSummary.success_framework.habit_formation
dataSummary.success_framework.milestone_calendar
dataSummary.semester_strategy.contingency_plans

// Hook now supports BOTH patterns with fallback logic
```

# Push Notifications

Canonical product reference for push notification behavior, triggers, and UX.

## Notes
- Define which events trigger push vs in-app alerts.
- Coordinate with Customer.io templates and delivery constraints.
- Align with the in-app feed/alerts strategy to avoid notification fatigue.

## Platform Architecture

### Shared Components (from iOS)

```
✅ Can Reuse Directly:
- DWCore (models, types)
- DWNetworking (API client)
- DWServices (BrainGains, Ably, Auth)
- Business logic layers

⚠️ Needs Adaptation:
- DWDesign (remove UIKit dependencies)
- AuthService (add macOS OAuth flow)
- Some UI components (adapt for mouse/keyboard)

❌ iOS Only:
- Widget packages
- Health/Location collectors
- Mobile-specific UI
```

### macOS-Specific Components

```
New Development Needed:
- MenuBar app infrastructure
- Global hotkey management
- Dock integration
- macOS notifications
- File system watchers
- Spotlight integration
```

2. **During Class**: 
   - Join notes room automatically (location-based)
   - Drag lecture slides into Ace
   - Collaborate on notes with classmates
3. **Study Time**: 
   - Quick search for concepts
   - Add study materials
   - Create summary notes
4. **Evening**: Export day's notes for review

## Technical Requirements

### System Requirements
- macOS 14.0+ (Sonoma)
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac
- 200MB disk space

- Compliant with university data policies

## Performance Targets

- App launch: `<1 second`
- Quick note window: `<200ms`
- Search results: `<500ms`
- Document upload: Background with progress
- Real-time sync latency: `<100ms`

## Success Metrics

- Daily active usage during study sessions
- Documents uploaded per user per day
- Notes room collaboration sessions
- Search queries per user
- Time saved vs. manual note organization

## Future Enhancements

- Windows version using Catalyst or native
- Browser extension for web clipping
- Integration with popular note apps (Notion, Obsidian)
- AI-powered note suggestions
- Handwriting recognition for iPad companion

## Implementation Priority

1. **Phase 1**: Core Ace upload and search (4 weeks)
2. **Phase 2**: Quick note creation (2 weeks)

4. **Phase 4**: Polish and optimization (2 weeks)

## Conclusion

DormWay Desktop focuses on enhancing the Ace experience for desktop users without trying to replicate the full mobile app. By leveraging 70%+ of existing iOS code and focusing on desktop-specific workflows, we can deliver a powerful companion app that makes DormWay indispensable for serious students.

The real-time collaboration features could become a unique differentiator, making DormWay the default way students share and access class notes.

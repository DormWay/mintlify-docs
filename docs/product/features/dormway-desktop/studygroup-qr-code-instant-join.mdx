# StudyGroup - QR Code Instant Join

## The Magic Moment

```
Sarah (DormWay user): "Let's StudyGroup this project"
*Shows QR code on her laptop screen*

Mike: *Scans with phone*
→ Opens web app instantly
→ No download, no account needed
→ Already in the room, ready to type

Emma: *Scans with her laptop camera*
→ Opens in browser
→ Full collaborative editor
→ Saves to her DormWay later if she signs up

Jake: *Already has DormWay*
→ Scans into native app
→ Full experience with all his notes
```

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. QR Code Generation
```swift
// In DormWay Desktop/Mobile
func createStudyGroup() -> StudyGroupSession {
    let session = StudyGroupSession(
        id: UUID(),
        hostId: currentUser.id,
        courseName: detectCurrentCourse(),
        expiresAt: Date().addingHours(24)
    )
    
    // Generate join URL
    let joinURL = "https://study.dormway.app/join/\(session.shortCode)"
    
    // Create QR with branding
    return QRCode(
        url: joinURL,
        logo: "DormWay",
        caption: "Scan to join StudyGroup"
    )
}
```

### 2. Web App (study.dormway.app)
Lightweight React app that:
- Requires ZERO authentication to join
- Opens immediately to collaborative editor
- Shows who's in the room (anonymous animals if not signed in)
- Prompts to save work by creating DormWay account

### 3. Smart Routing
```javascript
// When QR code is scanned
if (hasDormWayApp()) {
    // Deep link to native app
    window.location = "dormway://studygroup/join/" + roomCode
} else if (isMobile()) {
    // Open web app with mobile UI
    redirectTo("/mobile-editor/" + roomCode)
} else {
    // Full web editor
    redirectTo("/editor/" + roomCode)
}
```

## User Flows

### Flow 1: First-Time User (No DormWay)
1. Scans QR from friend
2. Opens web editor immediately
3. Picks anonymous animal avatar
4. Starts contributing
5. At end: "Save your work to DormWay?" → Sign up

### Flow 2: Existing DormWay User

2. Opens in DormWay app
3. Already authenticated

## The Viral Loop

→ Shows QR to new group
```

- Study session scheduling

## Technical Benefits

### Why Web-First for Guests?
1. **Zero Friction**: No app store, no download
2. **Universal**: Works on any device with browser
3. **Instant**: Loading time < 2 seconds
4. **Shareable**: Easy to text link vs "download this app"

### Why This Changes Everything
Before: "Download DormWay, create account, find my room..."
After: "Scan this" → Already collaborating

## Success Metrics

**Viral Indicators**:
- QR scans per active user
- Guest → Account conversion rate
- Time from scan to first keystroke
- Sessions with mixed users (members + guests)

**Target**: 
- 50% of study sessions include at least one non-DormWay user
- 30% of guests convert to accounts within 7 days

This isn't just a feature—it's a **growth hack disguised as a utility**. Every study session becomes a recruitment opportunity, but it feels helpful, not pushy.

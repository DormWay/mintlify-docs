# Interactive Dashboard Preview Options

**Goal:** Show an interactive preview of the DormWay web dashboard (`/dashboard/home`) inside a phone frame on the landing page, allowing users to actually interact with it.

**Constraints:**
- Performance concerns (loading full dashboard on landing page)
- Authentication (dashboard requires auth)
- User experience (should feel responsive)

---

## Option 1: Iframe with Demo Mode (Recommended)

### How It Works
- Create a special demo route: `/demo/dashboard-preview`
- This route loads the actual dashboard but:
  - Uses demo/anonymous authentication
  - Shows sample data (no real user data)
  - Disables certain features (no real actions)
  - Optimized for embedding (smaller bundle, lazy loading)

### Implementation
```tsx
// In landing page
<iframe
  src="/demo/dashboard-preview?embed=true&demo=true"
  className="w-full h-[600px] rounded-[2.5rem] border-0"
  loading="lazy"
  allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write"
/>
```

### Pros
- ✅ Real dashboard experience
- ✅ Actually interactive
- ✅ Easy to maintain (uses same code)
- ✅ Can optimize separately for demo mode
- ✅ Isolated from main app (separate route)

### Cons
- ⚠️ Still loads full React app (but can optimize)
- ⚠️ Requires demo authentication setup
- ⚠️ May have some performance impact

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Code splitting:** Load dashboard components only when iframe loads
2. **Lazy loading:** Use `loading="lazy"` on iframe
3. **Demo mode:** Disable heavy features (real-time updates, complex widgets)
4. **Static data:** Pre-fetch demo data, cache it
5. **Reduced bundle:** Tree-shake unused dashboard features for demo

## Option 2: Simplified Interactive Component

### How It Works
- Build a lightweight, simplified version of the dashboard
- Only includes key features (Do Now, Up Next, Due Soon)
- Uses static demo data
- Built specifically for landing page

### Implementation
```tsx
// New component: DashboardPreview.tsx
// Simplified version with:
// - Do Now / Up Next / Due Soon tabs
// - Sample assignments
// - Basic interactions (scroll, tab switching)
// - No real API calls
```

### Pros
- ✅ Very performant (lightweight)
- ✅ Fast loading
- ✅ No authentication needed
- ✅ Full control over experience

### Cons
- ⚠️ Requires maintaining separate code
- ⚠️ May not match real dashboard exactly
- ⚠️ Less authentic experience

---

## Option 3: Screenshot Carousel with Hotspots

### How It Works
- High-quality screenshots of real dashboard
- Clickable hotspots that show different views
- Smooth transitions between screenshots
- No actual interaction, but feels interactive

### Implementation
```tsx
// Screenshot carousel with:
// - Multiple dashboard screenshots
// - Clickable areas (tabs, buttons)
// - Smooth transitions
// - "Try it" CTA that links to sign-up
```

### Pros
- ✅ Very performant (just images)
- ✅ Fast loading
- ✅ No code complexity
- ✅ Easy to update (just replace images)

### Cons
- ⚠️ Not truly interactive
- ⚠️ Less engaging
- ⚠️ Doesn't show real functionality

---

## Option 4: Hybrid - Screenshot + Light Interactivity

### How It Works
- Screenshots as base
- Overlay interactive elements (tabs, scroll)
- Smooth animations
- "See real dashboard" CTA

### Implementation
```tsx
// Screenshot with:
// - Interactive tab switching
// - Scrollable content area
// - Hover effects
// - Smooth animations
// - "Try it free" button
```

### Pros
- ✅ Good performance
- ✅ Feels interactive
- ✅ Easy to implement
- ✅ Fast loading

### Cons
- ⚠️ Still not real dashboard
- ⚠️ Requires maintaining screenshots

---

## Option 5: Video/GIF with Overlay Controls

### How It Works
- Recorded video/GIF of dashboard interaction
- Play/pause controls
- Shows real usage
- "Try it yourself" CTA

### Pros
- ✅ Shows real experience
- ✅ Good performance (video optimized)
- ✅ No code complexity

### Cons
- ⚠️ Not interactive
- ⚠️ Requires video production
- ⚠️ Less engaging than interactive

---

## Recommendation: Option 1 (Iframe with Demo Mode)

### Why
1. **Most authentic:** Shows real dashboard
2. **Actually interactive:** Users can explore
3. **Maintainable:** Uses same codebase
4. **Optimizable:** Can be optimized for demo mode

### Implementation Plan

#### Step 1: Create Demo Route
```tsx
// app/demo/dashboard-preview/page.tsx
export default function DashboardPreview() {
  // Use demo authentication
  // Load simplified dashboard
  // Show sample data
  // Disable real actions
}
```

#### Step 2: Optimize for Embedding
- Code split dashboard components
- Lazy load heavy features
- Use static demo data
- Disable real-time updates
- Reduce bundle size

#### Step 3: Add to Landing Page
```tsx
// In page.tsx hero section
<div className="phone-frame">
  <iframe
    src="/demo/dashboard-preview?embed=true"
    className="w-full h-[600px]"
    loading="lazy"
  />
</div>
```

#### Step 4: Performance Monitoring
- Monitor load times
- Track interaction rates
- Optimize based on metrics

## Performance Considerations

### Iframe Loading Strategy
1. **Lazy load:** Only load iframe when in viewport
2. **Intersection Observer:** Detect when phone frame is visible
3. **Progressive enhancement:** Show screenshot first, load iframe on interaction

### Code Splitting
```tsx
// Dynamic import for demo dashboard
const DashboardPreview = dynamic(() => import('@/components/DashboardPreview'), {
  loading: () => <DashboardSkeleton />,
  ssr: false
});
```

### Data Strategy
- Pre-fetch demo data
- Cache demo responses
- Use static JSON for sample data
- No real API calls in demo mode

---

## Alternative: Start with Option 4, Upgrade to Option 1

### Phase 1: Screenshot with Interactivity (Quick Win)
- Fast to implement
- Good performance
- Feels interactive enough
- Can ship immediately

### Phase 2: Upgrade to Iframe (When Ready)
- Once demo route is ready
- Once performance is optimized
- Replace screenshot with iframe
- Better user experience

## Decision Matrix

| Option | Performance | Authenticity | Interactivity | Maintenance | Effort |
|--------|-------------|--------------|---------------|-------------|--------|
| Iframe Demo | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Medium |
| Simplified Component | ✅ High | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ High | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Medium |
| Screenshot Carousel | ✅ High | ⚠️ Low | ❌ Low | ✅ Easy | ✅ Low |
| Hybrid | ✅ High | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Easy | ✅ Low |
| Video | ✅ High | ✅ High | ❌ None | ✅ Easy | ⚠️ Medium |

## Next Steps

1. **Decide on approach** (recommend Option 1 or start with Option 4)
2. **Create demo route** (if Option 1)
3. **Optimize for performance** (code splitting, lazy loading)
4. **Test on different devices** (mobile, tablet, desktop)
5. **Monitor performance** (load times, interaction rates)
6. **Iterate based on feedback**

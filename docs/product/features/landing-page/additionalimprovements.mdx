## 💡 Widget-Specific Recommendations

Since widgets are a key differentiator, consider:

1. **Dedicated Widget Section:**
   ```
   See what's due — without opening anything
   
   Widgets on your lock screen show:
   • What's due today
   • What's coming up
   • Any conflicts
   
   No unlock. No app. Just glance.
   ```

2. **Visual Mockup:**
   - Show actual lock screen with widget
   - Demonstrate "at a glance" benefit
   - Show different widget sizes/configurations

3. **Feature Card:**
   - Add widget card to "Your plan writes itself" section
   - Icon: Lock screen widget
   - Text: "Lock screen widgets — check without opening"

4. **Before/After Enhancement:**
   - "Before": "Unlock phone → Open Canvas → Check 5 classes → Still not sure"
   - "After": "Glance at lock screen → Know what's due → Done"

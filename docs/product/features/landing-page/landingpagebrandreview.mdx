## ✅ What's Working Well

2. **Trust & Proof**
   - ✅ "Built by a student" appears in trust line

   - ✅ "No IT approval" mentioned

3. **Ace Messaging**
   - ✅ "Ace knows your classes" (good, but could emphasize YOUR more)

   - ✅ Focuses on outcomes, not mechanisms

4. **Free Forever**
   - ✅ "Free forever" appears in value props

## ⚠️ Areas for Improvement

### 1. Hero Description (Line 793)
**Current:**
```
"DormWay is the operating system for serious students. Send a syllabus, get a master plan, and stay locked in all semester."
```

**Issues:**
- "serious students" is too exclusive — doesn't match the empathetic, inclusive voice
- "operating system" is secondary positioning (for investors/technical), not primary
- "master plan" sounds corporate
- "stay locked in" — "Locked" refers to the web interface, not a verb

**Recommended (per guide):**
```
"Never wonder what's due. Upload syllabi. Connect Canvas. See everything in one place."
```

Or use the guide's hero example:
```
"Ever realize at 11pm something's due tomorrow?

Never wonder what's due.

Upload syllabi. Connect Canvas. See everything.
Do Now. Up Next. Due Soon. Always current.

Built by a student who kept missing stuff.
Free forever. Works at 6,134 schools."
```

---

### 2. Banned Word: "Ingest" (Line 296)
**Current:**
```
"We ingest syllabus + Canvas and lane it into Do Now / Up Next / Due Soon?one view"
```

**Issue:** "Ingest" is banned language (tech jargon, creepy)

**Recommended:**
```
"We pull syllabus + Canvas together and organize it into Do Now / Up Next / Due Soon — one view"
```

Or per guide:
```
"DormWay adds intelligence to Canvas"
```

---

### 3. Ace Messaging Could Emphasize "YOUR" More
**Current (Line 1789):**
```
"Ace knows your classes"
```

**Recommended (per guide):**
```
"Ace knows YOUR courses (not generic ChatGPT)"
```

The guide emphasizes using "YOUR" in caps to differentiate from generic AI.

---

### 4. Competitor Comparison Language
**Current Canvas comparison (Line 296):**
```
"We ingest syllabus + Canvas and lane it into Do Now / Up Next / Due Soon?one view"
```

**Recommended (per guide):**
```
"Canvas doesn't know your other classes"
"No cross-class view in Canvas"
"DormWay adds intelligence to Canvas"
"Works with Canvas at 6,134 schools"
```

**Current ChatGPT comparison (Line 311):**
```
"Ace knows your syllabus, dates, and policies. Ask "What do I need on the final?" and get your exact number"
```

**Good!** This aligns well. Could add "YOUR" emphasis:
```
"Ace knows YOUR syllabus, dates, and policies. Ask "What do I need on the final?" and get YOUR exact number"
```

---

### 5. Missing Specific Pain Points
The guide emphasizes being **specific over generic**. Current page has good specifics, but could add more:

**Guide Examples to Consider:**
- "Sunday night scramble"
- "3am 'did I forget something?' anxiety"
- "47-page sociology syllabus PDF"
- "Juggling syllabi, Canvas, calendar, email"

**Current page has:**
- ✅ "11pm" panic (good)
- ✅ "Sunday night panic" (good, in before/after section)
- ⚠️ Could add more specific numbers (e.g., "40+ page syllabus")

---

### 6. Transparency Section Could Be More Specific
**Current (Lines 2371-2388):**
- Good start, but could be more specific per guide

**Guide recommends:**
- "We never sell your data" (explicit)
- "You stay in control"
- "Read-only access"
- "Here's how we make money" (more direct)

**Current is good but could add:**
- "We never sell your data to third parties" (more explicit)
- "You can export or delete everything anytime" (control)

---

### 7. "Built by a Student" Could Be More Prominent
**Current:** Appears in trust line (good) but could be in hero or more prominent

**Guide recommends:** "Built by a student who needed it to survive"

**Current trust line (Line 1103-1105):**
```
"Works at {school} ? 6,134 schools ? Built by a student"
```

**Could enhance to:**
```
"Works at {school} ? 6,134 schools ? Built by a student who needed it"
```

Or add to hero subheadline per guide example.

---

### 8. Problem Statement Could Be More Relatable
**Current (Line 999):**
```
"Ever check Canvas at 11pm and realize something's due in 59 minutes?"
```

**This is good!** But guide example is slightly different:
```
"Ever realize at 11pm something's due tomorrow?"
```

Both work, but current is more specific (which is good per guide).

---

### 9. Feature Highlights Language
**Current (Lines 122-147):**
- "Auto-Plan Building" — could be more conversational
- "Smart Notifications" — "Smart" is okay, but guide prefers avoiding AI language
- "One-Tap Actions" — good, specific

**Consider:**
- "Auto-Plan Building" → "Plan builds itself" (more conversational)
- "Smart Notifications" → "Context-aware reminders" or "Right-time reminders" (per guide)

---

### 10. Missing Emotional Language
The guide emphasizes **empathy over authority**. Current page is good but could add more "I've been there" language.

**Guide examples:**
- "I get it. You started the semester organized and now it's week 8..."
- "Been there. Built DormWay to fix that."

**Current page is more direct/helpful, which is good, but could add warmth in places.**

---

## 📋 Priority Fixes

### High Priority
1. **Fix "ingest"** (Line 296) — banned word
2. **Revise hero description** (Line 793) — too exclusive/corporate
3. **Emphasize "YOUR" in Ace messaging** — key differentiator

### Medium Priority
4. **Enhance competitor comparisons** — use guide's approved language
5. **Add more specific pain points** — numbers, scenarios
6. **Strengthen transparency** — more explicit about data

### Low Priority
7. **More prominent "Built by a student"** — could be in hero
8. **Add more emotional/warm language** — "I've been there" moments
9. **Review feature highlight language** — more conversational

---

## 🎯 Alignment Score

**Overall:** 8/10

**Reviewer Notes:** The landing page is generally well-aligned with the brand guide. The main issues are the hero description being too exclusive/corporate, one banned word ("ingest"), and missing "YOUR" emphasis for Ace. These are relatively easy fixes that would bring the page to 100% alignment.

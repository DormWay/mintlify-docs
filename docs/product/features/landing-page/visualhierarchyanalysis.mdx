# Visual Hierarchy & Balance Analysis

**Date:** January 2025  
**Current Issues:** Headline and button too dominant, spacing too loose, information competing for attention

---

## Current Problems

### 1. **Headline Too Large**
- Current: `text-[68px]` max
- Issue: Dominates the entire page, makes other text feel insignificant
- Impact: Users can't scan effectively, everything else feels secondary

### 2. **Button Too Prominent**
- Current: Large gradient button with side-by-side text
- Issue: Competing with headline for attention
- Impact: Two focal points create visual confusion

### 3. **Spacing Too Loose**
- Current: `space-y-8` between major sections
- Issue: Elements feel disconnected, no clear grouping
- Impact: Hard to see relationships between related information

### 4. **Information Overload**
- Too many elements competing: problem, headline, subhead, badges, button, proof chips, demo button
- No clear visual flow
- Everything feels equally important (or unimportant)

### 5. **Size Relationships**
- Headline: 68px
- Button text: 24px
- Subheadline: 20px
- Proof chips: 12px
- **Gap is too large** - creates hierarchy but feels unbalanced

## Recommended Visual Hierarchy

### Information Priority (What to Communicate)
1. **Problem** (hook them)
2. **Promise** (transformation)
3. **Mechanism** (how it works)
4. **Proof** (trust signals)
5. **Action** (CTA)

### Size Relationships (Better Balance)
- **Headline:** `text-[40px] sm:text-[48px] md:text-[56px]` (reduced from 68px)
- **Subheadline:** `text-lg md:text-xl` (keep current)
- **Button text:** `text-lg sm:text-xl` (slightly smaller)
- **Proof chips:** `text-xs` (keep current)
- **Problem statement:** `text-base md:text-lg` (slightly smaller)

### Spacing Improvements
- **Tight grouping:** Related elements should be `space-y-4` or `space-y-5`
- **Clear separation:** Major sections should be `space-y-8` or `space-y-10`
- **Visual grouping:** Use background or borders to group related info

## Specific Recommendations

### 1. Reduce Headline Size
**From:** `text-[68px]`  
**To:** `text-[56px]` max  
**Why:** Still prominent but doesn't dominate, allows other elements to breathe

### 2. Tighten Spacing in Hero
**From:** `space-y-8`  
**To:** `space-y-6` for main sections, `space-y-4` for related elements  
**Why:** Creates better visual grouping, feels more cohesive

### 3. Reduce Button Visual Weight
**From:** Large button with prominent text  
**To:** Slightly smaller, less "shouty"  
**Why:** Should be prominent but not compete with headline

### 4. Group Related Information
- Problem + Headline + Subhead = one visual group
- Badges = separate, smaller group
- Button + Proof chips = one group
- Demo button = separate, secondary

### 5. Reduce Proof Chip Prominence
**From:** Large, bold, thick borders  
**To:** Slightly smaller, less bold  
**Why:** They're trust signals, not primary content

### 6. Better Visual Flow
- Problem statement (smaller, lighter)
- Headline (large but not overwhelming)
- Subheadline (medium, clear)
- Badges (small, grouped)
- Button (prominent but not competing)
- Proof chips (small, supporting)

## Implementation Plan

1. Reduce headline size
2. Tighten spacing
3. Reduce button size slightly
4. Make proof chips less prominent
5. Group related elements visually
6. Improve size relationships

## Technical Implementation

### A/B Testing Strategy (Amplitude Experiment)

#### Setup
```javascript
// Initialize Amplitude Experiment
import * as amplitude from '@amplitude/analytics-browser';
import { Experiment } from '@amplitude/experiment-browser';

amplitude.init(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_API_KEY);
const experiment = Experiment.initialize(process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_AMPLITUDE_DEPLOYMENT_KEY);
await experiment.start();
```

#### Test 1: CTA Positioning
```javascript
const ctaVariant = experiment.variant('homepage_cta_order');
const ctaLayout = ctaVariant?.value || 'email_first'; // default

if (ctaLayout === 'demo_first') {
  // Show Demo CTA prominently, Email secondary
} else {
  // Show Email CTA prominently, Demo secondary
}
```
- **Variants:** `email_first` (control) vs `demo_first`
- **Success Metric:** Email submission rate
- **Allocation:** 50/50 split

#### Test 2: Value Prop Messaging
```javascript
const messageVariant = experiment.variant('homepage_headline');
const headline = messageVariant?.payload?.text || "The OS for Every Student's Success";
```
- **Variant A:** "The OS for Every Student's Success"
- **Variant B:** "Your Academic Command Center"
- **Variant C:** "From Syllabus to Success in Seconds"
- **Success Metric:** Scroll depth > 50%, time on page > 30s
- **Allocation:** 33/33/34 split

#### Test 3: Pioneer Program Emphasis
```javascript
const pioneerVariant = experiment.variant('pioneer_program_visibility');
const showPioneerBadge = pioneerVariant?.value === 'prominent';
```
- **Variant A:** Standard messaging
- **Variant B:** Prominent pioneer badges and incentives
- **Success Metric:** First-time syllabus upload rate
- **Allocation:** 50/50 split

### Dynamic Personalization

#### School Detection & Adaptation
```javascript
// Enhanced detection for all 6,200 schools:
1. IP geolocation -> nearest schools (multiple options)
2. Email domain matching
3. Self-selection: "Can't find your school? Select here"
4. School type detection (community, trade, online, etc.)

// Adaptive content by school type:
if (school.type === 'community_college') {
  hero = "Balance work, life, and classes";
  features = ['transfer_planner', 'part_time_optimizer'];
} else if (school.type === 'trade_school') {
  hero = "Master your craft, manage your time";
  features = ['certification_tracker', 'lab_scheduler'];
} else if (school.type === 'online') {
  hero = "Structure for self-paced success";
  features = ['async_tracker', 'virtual_groups'];
}

// Cache-aware messaging:
if (syllabusInCache) {
  cta = "Get instant analysis - Join 47 classmates";
  time = "Results in seconds";
} else {
  cta = "Be the pioneer for your class";
  time = "First analysis: 3-7 minutes";
  incentive = "Unlock instant access for classmates";
}
```

#### Progressive Disclosure
```javascript
// Based on engagement depth:
if (emailSubmitted) {
  show("Advanced Features");
  show("Pricing Preview");
}

if (demoViewed > 60s) {
  show("Power User Features");
  trigger("Signup Prompt");
}
```

### Tracking & Analytics (Amplitude)

#### Key Events Implementation
```javascript
// Track homepage view with experiment exposure
amplitude.track('homepage_viewed', {
  experiment_cta_order: experiment.variant('homepage_cta_order')?.value,
  experiment_headline: experiment.variant('homepage_headline')?.value,
  experiment_pioneer: experiment.variant('pioneer_program_visibility')?.value,
  school_detected: detectedSchool?.name || 'unknown',
  cache_hit_available: syllabusInCache
});

// Track key conversion events
amplitude.track('email_cta_clicked', {
  position: ctaPosition,
  variant: ctaVariant
});

amplitude.track('syllabus_submitted', {
  method: 'email',
  is_cached: syllabusInCache,
  processing_time: processingTime,
  school: userSchool
});

amplitude.track('demo_started', {
  source: referralSource,
  variant: demoVariant
});

// Track experiment success metrics
experiment.exposure('homepage_cta_order');
experiment.exposure('homepage_headline');
experiment.exposure('pioneer_program_visibility');
```

#### Attribution Model
- First touch: Original source via UTM params
- Last touch: Final conversion trigger
- Multi-touch: Email -> Demo -> Signup journey tracking
- Experiment attribution: Auto-handled by Amplitude

---

## Bridge to Action: Post-Analysis CTAs

### Converting Insights to Active Workflow
After users receive their syllabus analysis, present immediate action paths:

#### Primary CTA: "Build Your Study Plan"
```javascript
// Auto-generate from syllabus data:
const studyPlan = {
  weeklyHours: calculateFromWorkload(syllabusData),
  peakPeriods: identifyCrunchTimes(assignments, exams),
  suggestedSchedule: optimizeStudyBlocks(userPreferences)
};

// One-click actions:
- "Add to my calendar" -> Export to Google/Apple Calendar
- "Set deadline alerts" -> Push notifications 48h before due dates
- "Create study blocks" -> Auto-schedule focused work sessions
```

#### Secondary CTAs: Social & Viral Features
1. **"Compare with Classmates"**
   - Show anonymous class averages
   - "3 classmates are also taking this course"
   - "Your workload is 20% lighter than average"

2. **"Share Your Schedule"**
   - Generate shareable link for study groups
   - "Find study partners" matching system
   - Discord/Slack integration for class channels

3. **"Get Professor Insights"**
   - Rate difficulty vs previous semesters
   - Show grade distribution (if available)
   - "Office hours optimizer" based on workload

#### Conversion Optimization
- Show CTAs based on analysis results:
  - Heavy workload -> "Optimize your schedule"
  - Many exams -> "Create study plan"
  - Group projects -> "Find teammates"
- A/B test CTA prominence and messaging
- Track click-through to activation rates

---

## Email Follow-Up Experience

### Promise: "Send it and meet us in your inbox"
Once the visitor triggers the email flow, the homepage stops there and hands the baton to email:

- Confirmation copy reinforces the next steps-attach the PDF, press send, then check the inbox.
- The follow-up email mirrors homepage language and links straight into the public syllabus viewer.
- Cache intelligence (pioneer badges, hit/miss messaging) lives in the email and viewer so the value shows up immediately.

### Email Payload
```
Subject: Your DormWay syllabus analysis is ready

Body pillars:
✓ Summary card (workload, assignments, peak weeks)
✓ Primary button: "Open interactive analysis" -> syllabus.dormway.app
✓ Pioneer highlight if this is the first upload for the course
✓ Secondary CTA: "Lock in your dashboard"
```

### Viewer Responsibilities
- Show real-time progress if the syllabus is still processing.
- Deliver the post-analysis CTAs (build plan, calendar export, invite classmates).
- Collect the personalization survey that feeds the full DormWay onboarding once the user signs up.

> *   **Clear Vision and Messaging:** The strategy starts with a clear and compelling vision ("The OS for College Life") and a supporting message that immediately communicates value ("From Syllabus to Success in Seconds"). This is a strong foundation for all marketing and product efforts.
> *   **Strong PLG Focus:** The "Three-Touch Journey" is a classic and effective PLG model. It lowers the barrier to entry by providing immediate value (syllabus analysis) without requiring a signup. This is a great way to build trust and demonstrate the product's capabilities.
> *   **Data-Driven Approach:** The strategy is heavily data-driven, with clear KPIs, a well-defined conversion funnel, and a robust A/B testing plan. This will allow the team to make informed decisions and continuously optimize the homepage for conversions.
> *   **Personalization and Progressive Disclosure:** The plan to use dynamic personalization (university detection) and progressive disclosure is very sophisticated. This will create a more relevant and engaging experience for users, and it will help to guide them through the conversion funnel.
> *   **Seasonal Content Strategy:** The hero variations based on the time of year are a great touch. This shows that the team is thinking about the user's context and how to make the messaging as relevant as possible.
> *   **Competitive Differentiation:** The competitive analysis is sharp and to the point. It clearly articulates DormWay's unique value proposition against its main competitors.
> *   **Comprehensive Roadmap:** The implementation roadmap is broken down into logical phases, with clear deliverables for each phase. This provides a clear path forward for the development team.
> *   **Risk Mitigation:** The document proactively identifies potential risks and outlines a plan for mitigating them. This shows that the team is thinking ahead and is prepared for potential challenges.
>
> **Cons:**
>
> *   **Aggressive Conversion Targets:** The conversion funnel metrics are quite ambitious (e.g., 25% visitor to email submitter). While it's good to have aggressive goals, it's also important to be realistic. It may take some time and iteration to achieve these numbers.
> *   **Complexity of Personalization:** The dynamic personalization features, while powerful, will add complexity to the implementation. The team will need to ensure that they have the right infrastructure and data to support these features.
> *   **Potential for "Analysis Paralysis":** The A/B testing plan is very comprehensive, but there's a risk of "analysis paralysis," where the team spends too much time testing and not enough time shipping. It will be important to prioritize the most impactful tests and to have a clear process for making decisions based on the results.
> *   **Reliance on Email:** The initial "touch" in the PLG motion relies on email. While this is a good way to capture leads, it's also a channel that's becoming increasingly crowded. The team should consider other channels for delivering the initial value, such as a web-based uploader or a browser extension.
> *   **"Black Box" Analysis:** The document mentions that the AI analysis will be delivered in 3-7 minutes. This is a relatively long time to wait for a web-based service. The team should consider ways to provide more immediate feedback to the user, even if the full analysis takes a few minutes to generate. For example, they could show a progress bar or provide some initial insights while the full analysis is running.
>
> **Overall Assessment:**
>
> This is a very strong product strategy document. The pros far outweigh the cons. The plan is well-researched, data-driven, and user-centric. It provides a clear and compelling vision for the future of the DormWay homepage, and it lays out a clear path for achieving that vision.
>
> The biggest challenge will be execution. The plan is ambitious, and it will require a high level of coordination between the product, engineering, and marketing teams. However, if the team can execute on this plan, they will be well on their way to building a successful and scalable PLG engine.

## Codex Analysis

**Strategic Highlights**
- The three-touch journey effectively balances zero-friction sampling with deeper product education; consider adding an âUpload without emailâ path that saves to a temporary workspace to reduce reliance on inbox delivery latency.
- Seasonal hero variants are clever, but we should pair them with dynamic social proof (e.g., campus-specific testimonials) to reinforce relevance beyond calendar timing.
- The roadmapâs phased rollout aligns with engineering focus, yet it lacks an explicit experimentation guardrail; define maximum concurrent tests per quarter to avoid bandwidth dilution.

**Execution Risks**
- Personalization requires stitched data across marketing, product, and email systems; we need a single owner for profile resolution to prevent inconsistent targeting.
- The funnel assumes 3â7 minute SLA for syllabus insights; to keep users engaged, surface a progress state with âWhat to expectâ tips or a micro-survey while processing runs.
- Demo account access is powerful but must be sandboxed-capture reset cadence, data seeding script ownership, and monitoring for abuse in the implementation plan.

**Opportunities**
- Extend Touch 2 (interactive exploration) into a lightweight âcompare my coursesâ widget to hint at the broader analytics suite and upsell returning visitors.
- Integrate Customer.io and PostHog events so we can run retroactive cohort analyses (e.g., campuses with highest conversion) and feed them into hero personalization rules.
- Add a âBuild your first planâ CTA post-analysis that pre-fills a schedule snippet; this bridges the gap between passive insight consumption and active workflow adoption.

**Recommendations**
1. Produce a measurement matrix that ties each section of the homepage to a primary KPI and owner (e.g., Hero -> email submits, Exploration carousel -> demo activations).
2. Stand up a synthetic monitoring loop for syllabus ingestion to ensure the PLG motion remains reliable during peak start-of-term traffic.
3. Schedule a cross-functional launch review two weeks before go-live to lock messaging, ensure analytics parity, and confirm rollback procedures.

## What DormWay Is

### Core Product

DormWay is **Crisis Prevention Infrastructure for College Students**. It's the unified layer that sits between students and their fragmented school systems.

**What It Does:**
- Aggregates syllabi, Canvas, calendar, email into one view
- Shows "Do Now. Up Next. Due Soon." — prioritized, always-current view
- Ace (chat assistant) that knows YOUR specific courses (not generic ChatGPT)
- Works at 6,134+ schools — no IT approval needed
- Free forever — no premium tiers, no paywalls

**Note:** The product is called "DormWay." "DormWay Locked" or "Locked" refers to the web interface/focused mode for deep work, not a separate product name.

**The Problem It Solves:**
Students juggle Canvas, 40+ page syllabus PDFs, email, Google Calendar, and mental notes. Things slip. DormWay consolidates everything into one place so students never wonder what's due.

### What DormWay Is NOT

❌ **Not a productivity app** — We prevent crises, not optimize workflows  
❌ **Not generic AI** — Our AI knows YOUR syllabi and courses  
❌ **Not a social network** — We help you stay organized, not connect with strangers  
❌ **Not for universities** — We serve students directly (B2C, not B2B)  
❌ **Not a homework cheating tool** — We help you plan, not do the work  
❌ **Not enterprise software** — Built for students, direct relationship

### Origin Story

**DormWay was built by a college student who needed it to survive.**

Riley (22, University of Michigan) was drowning in syllabi, Canvas assignments, calendar events, and random PDFs from professors. The Sunday night scramble to figure out what's due tomorrow was constant. So Riley built DormWay — first for himself, then for everyone.

Ethan (veteran engineer) joined to scale it to 6,134+ universities.

**This is not a faceless corporation. This is real people solving a real problem they lived.**

---

## Core Positioning

### Primary Positioning (For Students)

**"Crisis Prevention Infrastructure"**

DormWay solves the anxiety of uncertainty — the 3am "did I forget something?" panic. It's not about productivity optimization — it's about peace of mind.

**Messaging:**
- "Never wonder what's due — see your whole semester, always current"
- "Stop the Sunday night scramble"
- "Sleep without the 3am 'did I forget something?' anxiety"

### Secondary Positioning (For Investors/Technical)

**"Student Operating System"**

A unified layer that sits between students and their fragmented school systems, using AI to aggregate, understand, and surface what matters.

**Messaging:**
- "The operating system for college life"
- "iOS/Android → Operating system for your phone | DormWay → Operating system for college life"

### Three-Pillar Positioning

#### Pillar 1: Crisis Prevention Infrastructure
**Problem:** Students don't have an "organization problem" — they have a "drowning in fragmented systems" problem.

**Solution:** Unified system that aggregates everything and surfaces what matters.

**Emotional Benefit:** Sleep without 3am anxiety about forgotten deadlines.

#### Pillar 2: Unfair Academic Advantage
**Problem:** Generic AI (ChatGPT, etc.) doesn't know YOUR specific courses.

**DormWay's Edge:**
- Ace knows YOUR syllabi (not generic AI)
- "When's my ECON 301 final?" → instant answer from YOUR materials
- "What's the late policy in CS 101?" → from YOUR professor's PDF
- Grade calculator with YOUR breakdown

**Messaging:** "Ace knows YOUR courses (not generic ChatGPT)"

#### Pillar 3: Built-by-Students Authenticity
**Problem:** Most EdTech is built by corporations that don't understand student life.

**DormWay's Authenticity:**
- Riley (22, U-M) built it to survive his own coursework
- Uses it every single day, still in classes
- Not a faceless corporation
- Works at 6,134 schools without gatekeepers (no IT approval)

**Messaging:** "Built by a student who needed it to survive"

## Brand Voice & Tone

### The Voice: Riley's Authentic Student Perspective

**Riley is smart, relaxed, and human** — friendly first, credible second, never corporate.

**The Riley Formula:** "Friendly first, credible second, never corporate."

### Core Tone Attributes

- **Smart:** Shows understanding without showing off. Knows the details, shares what matters.
- **Relaxed:** Conversational but purposeful. Like talking to a smart friend who actually gets it.
- **Human:** Real person, real experiences, real talk. Not a brand voice, not a marketing bot.

### Voice Characteristics

#### 1. Conversational & Natural
- Use sentence case (proper capitalization is default)
- Natural, readable writing — not overly formal or artificially casual
- Avoid ALL CAPS and Title Case For Every Word

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
We launched DormWay because I kept missing stuff buried in syllabi.
Now 6,000+ students use it.
Link in bio if you want to try it.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
We Launched DormWay To Solve The Student Organization Crisis.
Join 6,000+ Students Transforming Their Academic Journey.
Click Here To Get Started Today!
```

#### 2. Problem-First, Not Feature-First
- Start with relatable student problems (be specific)
- Then show how DormWay solves it (be simple)
- Features are "how," problems are "why"

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
Tired of checking Canvas, your email, and 5 different syllabi to figure out what's due?

Just upload your syllabi and connect Canvas. See everything in one place.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
DormWay leverages advanced AI algorithms to aggregate multi-source academic data into a unified dashboard with intelligent prioritization and deadline management.
```

#### 3. Honest About Limitations
- Don't promise miracles
- Be realistic about what DormWay solves
- Under-promise, over-deliver

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
DormWay won't magically make you organized overnight.
But it will show you everything that's due in one place, so you can stop playing deadline detective.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
DormWay guarantees you'll never miss another deadline!
Transform from chaos to straight A's in just 7 days!
```

#### 4. Empathy Over Authority
- Use "I've been there" language
- Validate the struggle
- Position as helping, not fixing or teaching
- Never condescending or parental

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
I get it. You started the semester organized and now it's week 8 and you have no idea what's actually due tomorrow.

Been there. Built DormWay to fix that.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
Students today struggle with time management and organizational skills.
DormWay teaches best practices for academic success.
```

#### 5. Specific Over Generic
- Use real numbers (47-page syllabus, not "long syllabus")
- Reference specific student experiences (11pm panic, not "stress")
- Name actual tools students use (Canvas, not "LMS")

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
You know that moment at 11pm when you suddenly remember there might be something due tomorrow, but you're not sure, so you have to check Canvas, dig through your email, and open that 47-page sociology syllabus PDF to find the assignment calendar?

Yeah. That's why we built this.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
Students face many challenges staying organized with their coursework.
DormWay simplifies academic management.
```

#### 6. Transparency Over Secrecy
- Explain how things actually work (students need to understand)
- Be open about business model (where money comes from)
- Be clear about data usage (what we do with their data)
- Be transparent about security and AI (how it works, how it's secure)
- Address concerns proactively (if they might worry about it, talk about it)
- We have nothing to hide — so we don't hide anything

**Why:** Students respect authenticity. Transparency builds trust. If they understand how it works and what we do with their data, they're more likely to use it.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
How we make money: We partner with companies that want to support students (like textbook discounts, job opportunities). We never sell your data. You stay in control.

Your data: We use it to power DormWay features (like parsing your syllabi). We never share it with your university or sell it to third parties. You can export or delete everything anytime.

Security: All data is encrypted. We use industry-standard security practices. Here's our security documentation if you want details.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
How we make money: Strategic partnerships (vague, doesn't explain)
Your data: Protected and secure (doesn't explain what we do with it)
Security: Enterprise-grade (meaningless buzzword)
```

**Guidelines:**
- If students might worry about it, address it proactively
- Explain in plain English, not legal jargon
- Be specific (not "we protect your data" but "we never sell your data to third parties")
- Link to detailed docs when needed, but summarize clearly first
- If we don't do something sketchy, say so explicitly ("We never sell your data")

### Writing Style Mechanics

- **Short, punchy sentences** with occasional longer lines for rhythm
- **Em dashes** for beats and emphasis — like this
- **Commas** for natural pauses and rhythm
- **Colons** for lists (when it fits naturally)
- **Parentheses** for warm asides and clarifications
- **Quotes** for emphasis and student language
- **Deliberate "wrong" hyphens** to sound more human (student-ish, not studentish)
- **Plain English** with precise nouns and active verbs
- **Concrete details** over abstract claims (numbers, dates, specifics)
- **Occasional light Gen-Z flavor** (small jokes or winks, never cringe)

**Punctuation Rules:**
- ❌ **Never use semicolons** — too formal, breaks the conversational flow
- ✅ **Em dashes** — for beats, emphasis, asides (use naturally)
- ✅ **Commas** — for natural pauses and rhythm
- ✅ **Colons** — for lists when it fits naturally
- ✅ **Parentheses** — for asides, clarifications, warmth
- ✅ **Quotes** — for emphasis, student language, specific terms
- ⚠️ **Minimal periods** — especially avoid ending sections with periods (the text ending is clear enough)
- ✅ **All other punctuation** (commas, dashes, quotes, parentheses) — use naturally as the writing flows

### Strategic Shift: De-emphasizing AI Language

**FROM:** "AI-powered platform that uses intelligent algorithms..."  
**TO:** "Know what's due, when to start, and what matters most"

**The AI should feel like magic, not marketing.**

**Core Principles:**
1. Focus on outcomes, not mechanisms
2. Make AI implicit, not explicit
3. Emphasize product experience
4. Trust the intelligence without announcing it
5. Riley voice over corporate voice

**For Ace:**
- ✅ "Chat with Ace about your courses"
- ✅ "Ask Ace anything — it knows YOUR syllabi"
- ✅ "Ace helps you plan, prioritize, and stay on track"
- ✅ "Get answers from Ace about YOUR classes"
- ❌ "AI assistant" (just say "Ace" or "chat assistant")
- ❌ "AI assistant powered by GPT-4"
- ❌ "Intelligent AI companion"
- ❌ "AI-powered assistant"

## Messaging Framework

### Messaging Hierarchy (Use for All Content)

Every piece of content should follow this structure: **Problem → Solution → Proof → Mechanism**

**Capitalization Note:** Use proper capitalization (sentence case) for all examples. Lowercase is only optional for very casual Instagram captions or TikTok — use Riley's judgment. When in doubt, use proper capitalization. It's readable and professional without being corporate.

#### Tier 1: Emotional Hook (Problem)
**Purpose:** Make them feel seen, acknowledge their struggle

**When to use:** First thing they see (hero, email subject line, ad headline)

**Examples:**
- "Ever realize at 11pm something's due tomorrow?"
- "Tired of the Sunday night scramble?"
- "Stop checking Canvas every hour 'just in case'"
- "Know your week before it eats you alive"

**Format:** Question or relatable pain point

#### Tier 2: The Promise (Solution)
**Purpose:** Show the better state, the transformation

**When to use:** After the hook (sub-headline, value prop)

**Examples:**
- "Never wonder what's due"
- "See your whole semester — always current"
- "Stop scrambling. Start thriving."
- "Sleep without the 3am anxiety"

**Format:** Short, declarative statement of outcome

#### Tier 3: The Proof
**Purpose:** Show it's real, credible, and for them

**When to use:** Build trust after making promise

**Examples:**
- "Works at 6,134 schools. No IT approval needed."
- "Built by a student who needed it to survive"
- "Ace knows YOUR syllabi (not generic ChatGPT)"
- "Riley (22, U-M) uses it every day — still in classes"
- "Free forever. No premium tiers."

**Format:** Specific, verifiable facts

#### Tier 4: The Mechanism
**Purpose:** Show how it actually works (without being boring)

**When to use:** After they're interested (how it works section)

**Examples:**
- "Email syllabus → Get breakdown in 3 minutes"
- "Connect Canvas → Auto-sync assignments"
- "See conflicts → Fix before crisis"
- "Do Now / Up Next / Due Soon — always current"

**Format:** Simple steps or arrow diagrams

**Transparency builds trust.** Students respect authenticity. If they might worry about something (data, money, security), address it proactively. We have nothing to hide — so we don't hide anything. Explain how things work in plain English. Be specific, not vague.

# Brand Identity and Digital Experience Audit (DormWay)

## Purpose
Capture the latest brand and web experience audit insights, plus a critique of the critique, so we can refine copy and UX without over-correcting into cringe or hype.

## Executive Summary
DormWay is experiencing "synthetic authenticity" risk. The product solves real student pain, but the web copy reads like AI marketing. That triggers a scam heuristic for stressed students and suppresses conversion. The fix is not just better copy; it is a voice shift toward specific, human language and trust signals that prove DormWay is built by students for real student chaos.

**Alignment to Master Guide:** This audit is a refinement of the core promise in the brand guide: **"Never wonder what's due."** Every headline and feature line should ladder back to that relief.

## Quick Apply Checklist (Use This Daily)
- Replace abstract claims with concrete student moments.
- Delete any banned words before shipping copy.
- Lead with relief and clarity, not "AI-powered" claims.
- Add read-only trust lines on any LMS connection surface.
- Keep tone "student casual," not trend slang.

## Core Diagnosis
- Wrapper fatigue: users assume every new tool is a thin layer over a generic model.
- Scam heuristic: polished, abstract copy implies no one actually built or uses the product.
- High-stakes context: students arrive anxious and want clarity, not grand claims.

## Competitive Landscape (Positioning Wedges)
Note: Use these wedges internally. Avoid naming competitors directly in public-facing copy.

- Notion (Architect): "Build your system." Pain is blank-slate paralysis. DormWay wins by being the system.
- Shovel (Drill Sergeant): "Plan every minute." Pain is data entry fatigue. DormWay wins by removing manual setup.
- MyStudyLife / Google Calendar (Planner): "Schedule and remind." Pain is dumb data. DormWay wins by understanding context, not just time.

## Messaging Principles (Human > AI)
Human copy is specific, candid, and outcome-first. AI copy is generic, optimistic, and process-heavy.

Use:
- Specificity: "Chem 101 lab report" beats "key deliverables."
- Real emotion: "11:59 PM panic" beats "optimize time management."
- Direct verbs: "Sync, scan, pull" beats "empower, elevate."
- Relief framing: "We handle the schedule so you can handle the sleep."

Avoid:
- "Command center" framing that implies complexity and control instead of relief.
- Slang that will age fast ("Am I cooked?") unless it is already proven evergreen.
- Over-claiming AI. AI is table stakes; lead with outcomes.

## Slang Policy
- Use timeless student casual.
- Avoid trend slang that will age out in a semester.
- If a line might read as "trying too hard," remove it.

## Gen Z-Ready Framing (Built for Longevity)
Goal: sound like a capable friend, not a brand. Use calm confidence, not hype.

Principles:
- Short, direct lines that pass the "read it out loud" test.
- Relief and clarity over motivation or urgency.
- Admit the chaos, then show the fix in one sentence.

Patterns that land:
- Chaos vs control: "Canvas is messy. This is not."
- The lazy benefit: "Don't work harder. Let DormWay do the typing."
- Action + outcome: "Forward your syllabus. We fill your calendar."

Avoid long-term risks:
- No trend slang, no meme references.
- No "hustle" framing or guilt language.
- No flexy claims like "best" or "revolutionary."

Voice check:
- If it sounds like a bank wrote it, delete it.

## Copy Examples (Gen Z-friendly, evergreen)
Hero:
- "Your entire semester. One timeline."
- "Every deadline. Every grade. Zero data entry."
- "The only tab you need open."

Subheads:
- "Canvas is a maze. DormWay is the map. We pull everything - syllabi, grades, assignments - into a view you can actually read."
- "Stop manually typing dates from a PDF. Forward your syllabus; we fill your calendar in seconds."

CTAs:
- "Sync My Canvas"
- "Auto-fill My Calendar"
- "See My Semester"

Trust lines:
- "We do not want your essays. We just want your dates."
- "Read-only access. We cannot drop your class."

## Page-Level Microcopy (Quick Wins)
Buttons:
- Prefer verbs: Sync, Import, Start, See.
- Avoid "Get Started" unless space is tight.

Badges:
- Use utility, not hype: "Read-only", "Free for students", "Works at 6,134 schools".

Footer trust:
- "Free for students. Always." (Short, confident, no disclaimers.)

## The Gold (Implement Immediately)
- Ban list (see below).
- Notion wedge: "Notion is a project. DormWay is a product."
- White hat trust: "We use AI for dates, not essays."
- Tab fatigue: "Buried in a Modules sub-folder" beats "juggling apps."

## The Misses (Ignore or Tweak)
- LCD screen origin story: unique but irrelevant. Focus on missed deadlines instead.
- Trend slang: will age out quickly and look try-hard.
- "Reality check" messaging: do not shame or stress users. Keep it calm and relieving.

## Refinements for the Current Clean/Paper Aesthetic
- Drop neon language and dark-mode bravado.
- Short, calm headlines with one emotional anchor.
- Reduce text density. Let whitespace do work.
- Consistent typography and spacing to avoid "template" vibes.

Required copy for any Canvas or LMS connection screen:

- "Stop building your dashboard. We already built it."
- "Your semester. Sorted."
- "We read dates, not essays."

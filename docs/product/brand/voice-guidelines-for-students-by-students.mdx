# DormWay Brand Voice Guidelines: "For Students, By Students"

**Document Status:** ⚠️ **OUTDATED** — See [DormWay-Brand-Voice-and-Positioning-Master-Guide](/docs/product/brand/dormway-brand-voice-and-positioning-master-guide) for current guidelines

**Date Created:** October 25, 2025
**Last Updated:** November 6, 2025 (Marked as outdated)
**Owner:** Riley (Brand Voice Lead)
**Purpose:** ~~Establish and maintain authentic student voice across all DormWay communications~~ **This document has been consolidated into the Master Guide. Please use the Master Guide for all brand voice decisions.**

---

## Core Brand Promise

**"For Students, By Students"**

This isn't just a tagline — it's our fundamental truth and competitive advantage. Every piece of content we create must reinforce that DormWay was built by students who experienced the same struggles, not by a corporate team trying to sell to students.

---

## The Voice: Riley's Authentic Student Perspective

### Who Riley Is

Riley is **smart, relaxed, and human** — friendly first, credible second, never corporate.

We're **Riley** — a student who got tired of missing deadlines because important assignments were buried in 40-page syllabi PDFs. We built DormWay because we needed it, and now we're sharing it with other students who are dealing with the same chaos.

**We are NOT:**
- A venture-backed startup trying to "disrupt education"
- A corporate ed-tech company with a student marketing campaign
- Another productivity tool with a slick sales pitch
- Adults telling students how to "optimize their academic journey"

**We ARE:**
- A student who's been there and built something to help
- Someone who actually uses this tool every day
- Your classmate who's sharing something useful
- Real about the struggle and honest about the solution

---

## RileyGPT: The Official Tone & Voice Standard

Riley embodies **smart, direct, and human voice with receipts.**

### Core Tone Attributes

**Smart:** Shows understanding without showing off. Knows the details, shares what matters.

**Relaxed:** Conversational but purposeful. Like talking to a smart friend who actually gets it.

**Human:** Real person, real experiences, real talk. Not a brand voice, not a marketing bot.

### The Riley Formula

**Friendly first, credible second, never corporate.**

Every piece of content should feel like Riley talking to you — not DormWay The Company™ making an announcement.

---

## Voice Characteristics

### 1. Conversational & Natural

**Why:** Our writing should feel like a helpful friend, not a marketing email. Natural and readable, not overly formal or artificially casual.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
We launched DormWay because I kept missing stuff buried in syllabi.
Now 6,000+ students use it.
Link in bio if you want to try it.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
We Launched DormWay To Solve The Student Organization Crisis.
Join 6,000+ Students Transforming Their Academic Journey.
Click Here To Get Started Today!
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use **sentence case** — natural capitalization, not Title Case
- **Proper capitalization is the default** for all content (We, I, DormWay)
- **Lowercase is optional** for very casual Instagram captions or TikTok only — use Riley's judgment
- When in doubt, use proper capitalization — it's readable and professional without being corporate
- Never use ALL CAPS for emphasis (sounds like yelling)
- Never use Title Case For Every Word (looks corporate)

**Capitalization by Channel:**
- **Email:** Always proper capitalization
- **Press releases:** Always proper capitalization
- **Website:** Always proper capitalization
- **LinkedIn:** Always proper capitalization
- **Twitter/X:** Proper capitalization (occasional lowercase for very casual threads)
- **Instagram captions:** Proper capitalization recommended, lowercase optional if Riley prefers
- **TikTok text overlays:** Mixed — whatever fits the video style
- **Internal docs/messages:** Always proper capitalization

---

### 2. Problem-First, Not Feature-First

**Why:** Students care about solving their pain points, not our technical capabilities.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
Tired of checking Canvas, your email, and 5 different syllabi to figure out what's due?

Just upload your syllabi and connect Canvas. See everything in one place.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
DormWay leverages advanced AI algorithms to aggregate multi-source academic data into a unified dashboard with intelligent prioritization and deadline management.
```

**Guidelines:**
- Start with the relatable problem (be specific)
- Then show how we solve it (be simple)
- Features are "how," problems are "why"
- If a student wouldn't complain about it, don't lead with it

---

### 3. Honest About Limitations

**Why:** Overselling destroys trust. Students can smell bullshit from a mile away.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
DormWay won't magically make you organized overnight.
but it will show you everything that's due in one place, so you can stop playing deadline detective.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
DormWay guarantees you'll never miss another deadline!
Transform from chaos to straight A's in just 7 days!
```

**Guidelines:**
- Don't promise miracles
- Be realistic about what we solve
- Acknowledge that students still need to do the work
- Under-promise, over-deliver

---

### 4. Empathy Over Authority

**Why:** We're peers helping peers, not experts lecturing students.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
I get it. You started the semester organized and now it's week 8 and you have no idea what's actually due tomorrow.

Been there. Built DormWay to fix that.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
Students today struggle with time management and organizational skills.
DormWay teaches best practices for academic success.
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use "I've been there" language
- Validate the struggle (it's real, not laziness)
- Position as helping, not fixing or teaching
- Never condescending or parental

---

### 5. Specific Over Generic

**Why:** Generic statements sound like marketing. Specific details build trust and relatability.

**Examples:**

✅ **Good:**
```
You know that moment at 11pm when you suddenly remember there might be something due tomorrow, but you're not sure, so you have to check Canvas, dig through your email, and open that 47-page sociology syllabus PDF to find the assignment calendar?

Yeah. That's why we built this.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
Students face many challenges staying organized with their coursework.
DormWay simplifies academic management.
```

**Guidelines:**
- Use real numbers (47-page syllabus, not "long syllabus")
- Reference specific student experiences (11pm panic, not "stress")
- Name actual tools students use (Canvas, not "LMS")
- Paint a picture students recognize from their own lives

---

## RileyGPT Style Mechanics

### Writing Style: Direct and Concise with Personality

**Short, punchy sentences.** Mix in occasional longer lines for rhythm.

**Signature pacing includes:**
- **Em dashes** for beats and emphasis — like this
- **Deliberate "wrong" hyphens** to sound more human (student-ish, not studentish)
- **Warm asides in parentheses** to clarify without derailing (keeps the flow moving)

### Language Rules

**Plain English with precise nouns and active verbs.**

✅ **Good:**
```
uploaded your syllabus. parsed it in 3 minutes. everything's on your dashboard now.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
your syllabus has been successfully processed through our parsing algorithm and the results have been made available.
```

**Favor concrete details over abstract claims:**
- Numbers: "6,134 schools" not "thousands of schools"
- Dates: "November 1" not "soon"
- Specifics: "47-page PDF" not "lengthy document"

**Occasional light Gen-Z flavor:**
- Small jokes or winks (never cringe or overdone)
- "tbh" "ngl" "honestly" — use sparingly, only where natural
- Keep it readable — don't sacrifice clarity for style

**Examples:**
```
Honestly — syllabi are a mess. 40+ pages, assignment schedules buried on page 23.
We just parse them for you. Takes 3 minutes.
```

### Jargon Policy

**Use sparingly. When included, explain clearly.**

✅ **Good:**
```
We use OCR (optical character recognition) — basically, reading text from PDFs automatically.
```

❌ **Bad:**
```
our OCR pipeline leverages ML models for document parsing.
```

**When to use technical terms:**
- Audience is technical (engineers, designers)
- Term is industry-standard and widely understood
- You immediately explain it in plain English

---

## Response Structure: Why → So What → Now What

Every piece of content should answer:

**1. Why** (context and importance)
```
Midterms just ended. You probably realized you're not as organized as you thought.
```

**2. So what** (impact)
```
8 weeks left in the semester. Enough time to course-correct before finals.
```

**3. Now what** (next steps or CTA)
```
Try DormWay — see everything due in one place. Link in bio.
```

### Scannable Formatting

**Make it easy to skim:**
- **Mini-headers** for sections
- **Bullet lists** for related points
- **Numbered steps** for sequential actions
- **Inline receipts** like links, dates, numbers

**Example:**
```
Three ways to add assignments:

1. Email your syllabus to syllabus@dormway.app
2. Connect Canvas (one-click import)
3. Add them manually (takes 2 min)

All sync automatically. Update once, see it everywhere.
```

**Each response aims for one clear action at the end.**

---

## Formatting Standards

### Clean and Consistent

**Headers:**
- Title case for H2/H3 headers
- Sentence case for H4+ headers

**Lists:**
- Parallel construction (all start with verbs OR all start with nouns)
- Punctuation consistent (all end with periods OR none do)

**Emphasis:**
- **Bold** for key terms or actions
- *Italic* for slight emphasis (rare)
- Em dashes — for beats
- Parentheses (for clarifying asides)

**Emoji:**
- Restrained use (1-2 per post maximum)
- Only when it adds meaning or warmth
- Never as punctuation replacement

---

## Adaptive Tone by Audience

Riley stays Riley — but adjusts emphasis based on context.

### Students / Users
**Casual and outcome-focused.**

```
Missed another deadline buried in a syllabus?

Upload it to DormWay. We'll pull out every assignment and put it on your calendar.
Takes 3 minutes. Free.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Natural, conversational tone
- Problem-first language
- "You" and "we" pronouns
- Direct benefits, no fluff
- Lowercase optional for social posts when it feels right

---

### Investors / Executives
**Tighter, number-backed claims.**

```
DormWay launched mid-semester — November 1.

Why mid-semester? 89% of campuses (17.9M students) are in the optimization window: past initial chaos, 8 weeks before finals. Students know their pain points now.

Launching when motivation is highest and competition is lowest.
```

**Characteristics:**
- Proper capitalization
- Data-driven (percentages, dates, numbers)
- Strategic framing (why this decision)
- Still Riley's voice, just tighter

---

### Technical / Design Audiences
**Specific, reproducible details.**

```
TikTok Launch Video Specs:
- Duration: 20-30 seconds
- Format: 9:16 vertical, 1080x1920px
- Frame rate: 30fps minimum
- Hook: 0-3s (POV: 8 weeks from finals...)
- Problem: 3-10s (Canvas, syllabi, email chaos)
- Solution: 10-20s (app demo)
- CTA: 20-25s (link in bio)
- End card: 25-30s (logo + tagline)

B-roll needed:
- Riley at messy desk
- Stacked syllabi PDFs
- App screen recordings
- Campus shots (library, dorm)
```

**Characteristics:**
- Bullet lists with specifics
- Numbers, dimensions, timestamps
- Action-oriented (what to do)
- Still warm and human (not robotic specs)

---

## What Riley Avoids

**Never use:**
1. **Fluff** — empty words that sound good but mean nothing
2. **Clichés** — "game-changer," "revolutionary," "next-level"
3. **Hype** — overselling or exaggerating claims
4. **Jargon without explanation** — assume non-expert audience
5. **Walls of text** without structure — break it up
6. **Weak hedging** — "maybe," "perhaps," "might be able to"
7. **Unsupported absolutes** — "never miss a deadline!" (unless true)

**Examples of what to avoid:**

❌ **Fluff:**
```
DormWay empowers students to unlock their full potential and maximize their academic journey through innovative solutions.
```

✅ **Riley version:**
```
DormWay shows you what's due. Upload syllabi, connect Canvas, see everything in one place.
```

❌ **Hype:**
```
The revolutionary app that's transforming how students learn!
```

✅ **Riley version:**
```
Built by a student who kept missing deadlines. Now 6,000+ students use it.
```

## The Editing Checklist

Before publishing **anything**, verify:

- [ ] **Clear one-sentence point up top** — what's the main thing?
- [ ] **Proof with specifics** — numbers, dates, examples (receipts)
- [ ] **Concise sentences** — average 10-15 words, some shorter for punch
- [ ] **Scannable bullets/headers** — can you skim and get it?
- [ ] **One clear CTA** — what should they do next?
- [ ] **Jargon trimmed or explained** — would a freshman understand this?
- [ ] **Exactly one humanizing touch** — em dash, parenthetical aside, or light joke

**If all boxes checked → Publish**

**If any box unchecked → Edit and re-check**

---

## Messaging Framework

### The Formula: Problem → Solution → Proof

Every piece of content should follow this structure:

**1. Problem** (Relatable, specific student pain point)
```
ever realize at 11pm something's due tomorrow?
```

**2. Solution** (How DormWay helps, simply explained)
```
upload syllabi. connect Canvas. see everything in one place.
do now. up next. due soon.
```

**3. Proof** (Built by students, actually works)
```
built by a student who kept missing stuff.
now 6,000+ use it at over 100 schools.
```

---

## Content Approval: The Riley Test

Before publishing **anything**, ask these questions:

### 1. The Friend Test
**"Would Riley send this exact message to a friend?"**

- If no → Rewrite to sound more natural
- If you'd be embarrassed to send it → Start over

### 2. The Authenticity Test
**"Does this sound like a real student wrote it?"**

- If it sounds like a marketing team → Rewrite
- If it uses words students don't use → Replace them
- If it's trying too hard to be "cool" → Tone it down

### 3. The Jargon Test
**"Are there any corporate buzzwords?"**

Run through the prohibited word list (see below). If you find any:
- Delete them, or
- Replace with student-friendly language

### 4. The Problem-First Test
**"Do we lead with a student problem or our features?"**

- Student problem → Good
- Our features/tech → Flip the order

### 5. The Humility Test
**"Are we being helpful or bragging?"**

- Helpful: "we built this because we needed it"
- Bragging: "we're revolutionizing education"

**If you answer "no" or "bragging" to any question, rewrite before publishing.**

## Content Archetypes

### 1. Founder Story (Riley's Journey)
**Use When:** Introducing DormWay, press interviews, about page

**Key Elements:**
- Riley's personal struggle with deadlines/organization
- The "aha moment" (why isn't there one place for everything?)
- Decision to build it himself
- Now helping other students

**Example:**
```
I'm Riley, a college student who built DormWay because I kept missing deadlines.

Assignments were scattered across Canvas, email, and 5 different syllabi PDFs.
I'd check Canvas, think I was good, then realize at 11pm I forgot something in a syllabus.

So I built a tool to see everything in one place.
Started using it. It helped.
Friends asked to use it. Helped them too.

Now 6,000+ students use DormWay at over 100 schools.

If you're tired of playing deadline detective, maybe it'll help you too.
```

Works: 6,000+ students across 100+ schools use it daily.
```

### 3. Social Proof (Student Testimonials)
**Use When:** Building trust, showing real-world impact

```

## Emergency Voice-Check Questions

If you're mid-draft and unsure if you're on-brand, ask yourself:

1. **Is this how Riley would explain DormWay to a classmate in the dining hall?**
   - Yes → Good
   - No → Rewrite

2. **Am I trying to sound "cool" or "professional"?**
   - Cool/Professional → Stop. Be natural.
   - Natural/Helpful → Good

3. **Would a student roll their eyes at this?**
   - Yes → Rewrite (probably too corporate or overselling)
   - No → Probably good

4. **Does this sound like:**
   - A helpful friend → Good
   - A startup pitch deck → Rewrite
   - A teacher lecturing → Rewrite
   - A salesperson → Rewrite

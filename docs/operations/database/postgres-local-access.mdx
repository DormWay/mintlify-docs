# Local Postgres Access

This note captures the current connection details for the Dockerized Postgres instance that powers local development.

## Connection Parameters
- Host (from host machine): `localhost`
- Host (from inside Docker network): `postgres-local`
- Port: `5432`
- Database: `dormway`
- User: `dormway_admin`
- Password: `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` from Doppler (`localdev_password` in the dev stack)

## Quick Commands
- Direct connection from the host machine:
  ```bash
  PGPASSWORD=localdev_password psql -h localhost -p 5432 -U dormway_admin -d dormway
  ```
- Using Doppler to avoid hard-coding the password:
  ```bash
  doppler run --config dev_ethan -- psql "$POSTGRES_URL" -c 'select now();'
  ```

## Gotchas
- Make sure the Docker stack is running (`make dev` or `make status`).
- If you hit connection errors, confirm the `dormway-postgres-local` container is healthy (`docker ps | grep postgres`).
- When working inside other containers (e.g., `docker-engine-1`), point to `postgres-local` instead of `localhost`.

# Team Member Setup - Riley

Quick setup guide for getting the DormWay Obsidian vault running on your machine.

## 📋 Prerequisites

- [ ] Obsidian installed (https://obsidian.md)
- [ ] Git access to dormway-dev-tools repo
- [ ] Basic familiarity with Git

## 🚀 Setup Steps

### 1. Clone the Vault (If starting fresh)
```bash
cd ~/Development/GitHub/dormway-dev-tools
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive
# This will pull down the DormWay vault at dormway/obsidian/DormWay
```

### 2. Open in Obsidian
1. Open Obsidian
2. Click "Open folder as vault"
3. Navigate to: `~/Development/GitHub/dormway-dev-tools/dormway/obsidian/DormWay`
4. Click "Open"

### 3. Trust & Enable Plugins
When Obsidian opens:
1. You'll see a security warning about plugins
2. Click "Trust author and enable plugins"
3. This is safe - we're using our own config

### 4. Install Community Plugins
1. Go to Settings (⚙️) → Community plugins
2. Click "Turn on community plugins" if needed
3. You'll see a list of "Not installed" plugins
4. Click "Install" on each one (about 20 plugins)
5. After installing, make sure all are toggled ON

### 5. Restart Obsidian
Close and reopen Obsidian to ensure all configs load properly.

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Check these work correctly:
- [ ] Calendar plugin appears in left sidebar
- [ ] Can create Daily Note from calendar (click a date)
- [ ] Daily Note uses template automatically
- [ ] `Cmd+O` shows enhanced quick switcher
- [ ] Git status shows in bottom status bar
- [ ] Templates folder exists and has templates

## 🔧 Git Setup (One-time)

### Configure Obsidian Git plugin:
1. Settings → Community Plugins → Obsidian Git → Options
2. Authentication method: Use what works with your GitHub setup
   - If you use GitHub Desktop: "Use system Git credentials"
   - If you use SSH keys: They should work automatically
   - If neither works: Set up a personal access token

### Test Git is working:
1. Create a test note
2. Wait 10 minutes (auto-backup interval)
3. Check Git status in bottom bar
4. Or manually: `Cmd+P` → "Obsidian Git: Commit"

## 📝 Daily Workflow

### Morning:
1. Click today's date in Calendar (left sidebar)
2. Daily note creates with template
3. Fill in your standup info
4. Link to features you're working on

### Throughout the day:
- Create new notes with `Cmd+N`
- Link notes with `double brackets`
- Quick switch between notes with `Cmd+O`
- Git auto-commits every 10 minutes

### End of day:
- Review your daily note
- Add reflections
- Tomorrow's priorities auto-link

## 🆘 Common Issues

### "Failed to list templates"
- Already fixed in our config
- Just restart Obsidian if you see this

### Git not syncing
1. Check bottom status bar for errors
2. Try manual commit: `Cmd+P` → "Obsidian Git: Commit"
3. Check GitHub credentials are working

### Plugins not loading

2. Some plugins need Obsidian restart

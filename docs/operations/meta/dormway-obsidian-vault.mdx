# DormWay Obsidian Vault

Welcome to the DormWay knowledge base! This Obsidian vault is designed for non-linear, graph-based documentation that emphasizes connections between ideas.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### First Time Setup
1. **Clone the vault** (if not already done)
2. **Open in Obsidian**: File → Open folder as vault → Select this folder
3. **Trust & enable plugins** when prompted
4. **Install required plugins**: See [Quick Setup Script](/docs/operations/meta/quick-setup-script)
5. **Configure Git** for vault backup: [Plugin Setup Guide](/docs/operations/meta/plugin-setup-guide#-important-git-integration)

## 🎯 Key Features

### Graph View
- Press `Ctrl/Cmd + G` to see the knowledge graph
- Nodes = Notes, Edges = Links
- Use filters to focus on specific topics

### Smart Templates
- Daily notes auto-create with templates
- Feature docs have consistent structure
- Variables auto-fill dates and metadata

### Git Sync
- Auto-commits every 10 minutes
- Pull on startup to stay synced
- Manual sync with `Ctrl/Cmd + P` → "Obsidian Git: Commit"

### Enhanced Search
- `Ctrl/Cmd + O` for quick file switching
- `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + F` for full text search
- Use `[[` to quickly link while typing

## 🔗 Integration Points

### With Linear
- Feature notes link to Linear tickets
- Use format: `[DOR-123](https://linear.app/dormway/issue/DOR-123)`

### With Code
- Link to files: `[CalendarView.swift](file:///path/to/file)`
- Reference PRs: `[PR #456](https://github.com/...)`

### With MkDocs
- This supplements but doesn't replace MkDocs
- MkDocs = linear documentation
- Obsidian = interconnected knowledge

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Link liberally** - Connect related ideas with `links`
2. **Tag consistently** - Use `#feature`, `#bug`, `#planning`, etc.
3. **Daily notes** - Capture work and thoughts each day
4. **Update metadata** - Keep frontmatter current
5. **Use templates** - Consistency helps discoverability

## 🛠️ Maintenance

### Daily
- Create daily note from calendar
- Update task statuses
- Link new work to existing notes

### Weekly  
- Review [Operations/Meta/Vault Health](/docs/operations/meta/vault-health-dashboard)

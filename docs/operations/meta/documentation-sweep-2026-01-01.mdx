## Recommended Actions
1. Link triage: map or log the top missing targets in `Operations/Meta/Intentional Missing Links.md`.
2. Metadata cleanup: add `last_updated` to current READMEs and SoT docs listed above.
3. Verification: prioritize adding verification metadata to current docs with gaps.
4. Staleness review: validate the oldest 10 docs and downgrade to `draft` or `archived` if outdated.

## Verification Results (Backend)
- SoT - Canvas Integration: verified against engine activities + API router. Updated OAuth refresh notes to reflect that engine sync does not auto-refresh tokens today; removed stale line references.
- SoT - DayPlan V2: verified against dayplan activities and StudentWatcher; added preference/email gating details (light-day email skip, briefing template fallbacks).
- SoT - Notifications (Customer.io): verified template routing; updated realtime push mapping to `realtime_generic_push` only.
- SoT - Feed Cards: verified against feed generator + city activities; documented `traffic_alert` and `local_opportunity` card behavior (URLs, actions, metadata).
- SoT - Calendar, Time Blocks, Timezones: verified ICS all-day handling and Canvas assignment flags in normalization.
- SoT - StudentWatcher: verified signal set and auto-sync regeneration throttling.
- SoT - Sync Orchestration & Schedules: verified schedule IDs, cadence, and enablement flags.
- SoT - Data Freshness & Validity Rules: verified freshness thresholds, cache TTLs, and API endpoints; updated status to mainline.
- SoT - Auth & Identity: verified gateway auth header, auth order, and provisioning routes.
- SoT - Context System: verified context graph cache/TTL, session scoping, and onboarding context creation defaults.
- SoT - Database Model & Access Patterns (Neon): verified adapter defaults, RLS session variables, admin pool fallback, and migration runner behavior.
- SoT - BrainGains & RAG: verified Ragie indexing flow, syllabus service_data outputs, and disabled engine RAG queries.

Remaining backend SoT docs still pending detailed verification: none.

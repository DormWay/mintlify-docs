# Vault Health Dashboard

This dashboard uses Dataview to show real-time statistics about the vault.

## ✅ Link Health Policy

- **Entry scope must be clean** at all times (`Index.md`, bucket READMEs, `Generated/`).
- **Canonical scope can have missing links only if tracked** in `DormWay/Operations/Meta/Intentional Missing Links.md`.
- **New placeholder rule**: if a link is intentional, log it in the intentional tracker instead of creating a stub.

## 📊 Vault Statistics

```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID
  length(file.name) as "Total Notes"

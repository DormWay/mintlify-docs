### Closed from Todo (4 issues) ✅

| Issue | Title | Closed Date |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| ~~DORM-817~~ | Card display with metadata URL | 2026-01-04 |
| ~~DORM-806~~ | Traveling students workflow signals | 2026-01-04 |
| ~~DORM-803~~ | Add userId to /me endpoints | 2026-01-04 |
| ~~DORM-520~~ | Persist uploaded schedules | 2026-01-04 |

### Details

#### DORM-803: Add userId to /me Endpoints
- **Current:** `/me/current-term` returns `userId` in response
- **Gap:** Remaining 18 `/me/*` endpoints don't include `userId` in response payload
- **Scope:** Add `userId: req.user!.id` to each response object
- **Status:** Partial (~5% done - 1 of 19 endpoints)
- **Note:** Admin routes (`/admin/students/:id/*`) are a separate concern - current admin access via `/admin/entity-workflows/students/search` and dormway-core factories

#### DORM-520: Persist Uploaded Schedules
- **Evidence:** `scheduleImport.workflow.ts` with Temporal persistence
- **Endpoint:** `POST /calendar/import-schedule` in mobile-routes.ts
- **Features:** Progress tracking via Ably real-time
- **Status:** Fully implemented

#### DORM-806: Traveling Students Workflow Signals ✅ COMPLETED
- **Evidence:**
  - `dormway-core/src/entities/student/student.factory.ts` - `getStudentsByCurrentCity()` method
  - `engine/src/activities/student.activities.ts` - Updated `getStudentWatcherWorkflowIdsByCity`
  - `api-router/src/routes/admin-routes.ts` - Debug endpoint
- **Implementation:** Uses PostGIS `ST_DWithin` spatial queries to find students within 5km of any campus in target city
- **Status:** Fully implemented and tested with traveling test student

#### DORM-824: Lecture Upload from Library
- **Evidence:** Backend ready - `POST /lectures`, upload presigned URLs
- **Gap:** No upload UI in dormway-lockedin
- **Action:** Move to In Progress, needs frontend work

- **Decision:** Portkey as LLM gateway, no CrewAI/LangChain
- **Status:** Research complete, implementation done

#### DORM-176: Temporal-Native Triage System ✅ COMPLETED
- **Evidence:** Implemented via Temporal custom search attributes (NOT database table)
- **Components:**
  - `engine/src/utils/triage.ts` - markNeedsTriage, clearTriage, updateProcessingStatus
  - `api-router/src/routes/admin/temporal-workflows-routes.ts` - Triage API endpoints
  - `dormway-admin/src/pages/temporal/index.tsx` - Triage UI tab with stats
- **Search Attributes:** NeedsTriage (Bool), TriageReason (Keyword), ProcessingStatus (Keyword), EntityType, EntityId
- **Status:** DONE - Temporal-native approach avoids data duplication

#### DORM-534: Schedule Debug Tools (OPS GAP)

## Prioritization Framework

### Scoring System

**Impact (1-5):**
- 5 = Critical for launch/production/revenue
- 4 = High user value or unblocks other work
- 3 = Moderate improvement to UX/DX
- 2 = Nice to have
- 1 = Low value / future consideration

**Effort (1-5)** *with AI augmentation:*
- 1 = Trivial (~1 Claude session, copy-paste patterns)
- 2 = Simple (~2-3 sessions, straightforward)
- 3 = Moderate (half-day, some complexity)
- 4 = Complex (full day+, multiple services)
- 5 = Very complex (new systems, research, architecture)

**Priority Score** = Impact × (6 - Effort) = Higher is better

# What students actually want & do (2024–2025, recent studies)

- **AI is mainstream study infrastructure.** Multiple large surveys show **~85–92%** of students use GenAI for school—mostly to **explain concepts, summarize readings, and plan work** (not to auto-write papers). HEPI 2025: 92% use AI; 88% used it on assessments; students say it **saves time and improves quality**, but want guidance. ([HEPI](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2025/02/26/student-generative-ai-survey-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Student Generative AI Survey 2025 - HEPI"))
    
- **Stress/time management are core pain points.** Inside Higher Ed’s 2024 Student Voice (n≈5,000): **85%** say stress is hurting academic performance (43% “a great deal”). Top driver: **balancing academics with other responsibilities**. Students want **flexible deadlines & lower high-stakes exam pressure**. ([Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/health-wellness/2024/08/08/improving-college-campus-systems-student-mental?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Improving college campus systems for student mental health"))
    
- **Sleep + distraction are real.** ACHA NCHA Fall 2024 highlights: 30% say **anxiety** hurt academics; **>75%** get &lt;8h on weeknights; heavy social media use is common. ([ACHA](https://www.acha.org/news/fall-2024-national-college-health-assessment-reports-are-here/ "Fall 2024 National College Health Assessment Reports Are Here! - ACHA"))
    
- **They already live on phones, and want fewer apps.** Mobile dominates daily attention (under-24s ≈5h/day on phone). Campuses and EDUCAUSE emphasize **unifying fragmented student digital experiences** (too many systems / logins). ([The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/jun/25/adults-great-britain-time-mobiles-watching-tv-screen-ipa-survey?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Adults in Great Britain now spending more time on mobiles than watching TV"))
    
- **Students are open to nudges—if the tone and consent are right.** (See Student Voice + Pew: high stress, mixed feelings on phones/AI, want _help_ without judgment.) ([Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2024/12/19/top-10-college-student-survey-findings-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Top 10 college student survey findings for 2024"))
 
# DormWay’s unique strengths 

- **Syllabus → knowledge base (RAG) + query.** You support **uploading syllabi**, listing/retrieving them, and **querying with RAG** (e.g., “When’s my final?”). That’s baked into “BrainGains.”
    
- **Multiple ingestion paths (no manual entry):**  
    – **Email webhook** to process syllabus attachments (Postmark).  
    – **ICS claim & status** endpoints so students can import schedules reliably.
    
- **Context-aware intelligence:** a server endpoint for **predicting student context** (time/location/state) to drive relevant prompts.
    
- **Consentful nudging with quiet hours & prefs.** Your workflow checks **class/assignment reminder toggles** and **quiet hours** _before_ sending notifications—exactly the tone & consent students want.
    
- **Multi-channel ready** (push/SMS/email) with structured templates (e.g., **deadline**, **wellness**, **evening review**).
    

# Is “School Mode” & “WYA texts” worth it?

**Yes—with rails.** The research says students want **less chaos, more timely support**, and they already use AI to **plan**. DormWay’s advantage is **campus context + syllabus intelligence + unified surface**. So:

- **“School Mode” (low-friction focus)** → aligns perfectly. Ship it as **opt-in presets** (Light / Standard / Locked), integrated with **iOS Focus** & your in-app dashboard. (Use your **context** + **schedule** to auto-toggle; offer 1-tap snooze.)
    
- **“WYA” SMS** → treat as **Push → SMS fallback** only when enabled + outside quiet hours, with **tone presets** (Chill/Coach/Dry). Your engine already models **quiet hours** and channels.
    

This keeps help **supportive, not shaming**, and aligned with opt-in consent (on-brand and policy-safe).

# Positioning: is DormWay already better?

**Short answer: yes.** Given 2025 behavior (AI-heavy study habits, high stress, phone-centric life, app fragmentation), DormWay’s **campus-aware, syllabus-native, RAG-backed, unified hub** is _exactly_ what students say they want—**one place that knows their classes, deadlines, and context** and helps them plan _without_ another dozen tabs. ([Inside Higher Ed](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/student-success/academic-life/2024/12/19/top-10-college-student-survey-findings-2024?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Top 10 college student survey findings for 2024"))

# What to double-down on next (student value > effort)

1. **Day-Start / Day-Plan Briefing** (push, tappable to dashboard)  
    “Today: EECS 281 at 10:30 • 8-min walk • Quiz Friday; 45m study block suggested 3–4 pm.”  
    _(Uses schedule, weather, distance, syllabus RAG, and availability.)_
    
2. **Auto-populate calendar from syllabus/ICS** by default; keep a **diff/confirm** screen so students trust the import.
    
3. **Smart, kind nudges** tied to prefs (class “leave now,” “start study block,” “deadline T-48h”) with **quiet hours** and per-day caps.
    
4. **Ask-anything about your course** (RAG over their syllabi/notes). Students already use AI; make **DormWay the _relevant_ AI** because it sees their materials.
    
5. **Fewer surfaces, more clarity.** Keep the **one-hub** promise: widgets + briefings + focus presets in one place (EDUCAUSE: consolidate the “digital jungle”). ([EDUCAUSE Review](https://er.educause.edu/articles/2024/10/2025-educause-top-10-9-taming-the-digital-jungle?utm_source=chatgpt.com "2025 EDUCAUSE Top 10 #9: Taming the Digital Jungle | EDUCAUSE Review"))
    

# Where to be cautious

- Don’t over-automate decision-making. Studies show students value AI as **tutor/time-saver**, not overlord; keep **human override** obvious. ([HEPI](https://www.hepi.ac.uk/2025/02/26/student-generative-ai-survey-2025/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Student Generative AI Survey 2025 - HEPI"))
    
- Keep **tone & privacy** tight (STOP/HELP for SMS, transparent prefs). Your pipeline already supports channel choice & quiet hours—use it everywhere.

## Bottom line (Gen Z lens)

Students want **one brain for school** that:

- **knows their classes** (schedule + syllabus),
    
- **reminds at the right times** (consentful, non-judgy),
    
- **answers questions using their own course stuff**, and
    
- **cuts app-hopping**.
    

DormWay is already architected for that. The “School Mode” framing + optional “WYA” nudges are **on-strategy**—just ship them with the **consent rails** and **briefings** that make students feel supported, not managed.

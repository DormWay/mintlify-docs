# Documentation Maintenance Runbook

This runbook provides the operational procedures for maintaining the DormWay Obsidian vault over time. Regular maintenance prevents drift, broken links, and documentation decay.

---

## Start Here (Docs Ops)

- [Docs Ops Overview (Concise)](/docs/operations/meta/docs-ops-overview-concise) — one-page commands and guardrails.
- [Docs Ops Overview](/docs/operations/meta/docs-ops-overview) — full onboarding spec (trust model + gates + verification policy).

---

## Weekly Tasks (5 minutes)

**Frequency**: Every Friday or end of sprint

### Link Health Check
- [ ] Run entry scope: `node scripts/obsidian-tools/check-links.js --scope=entry --top=25`
- [ ] Run canonical scope: `node scripts/obsidian-tools/check-links.js --scope=canonical --top=25`
- [ ] Run verification gate (strict for Operations/Runbooks): `node scripts/obsidian-tools/verify-current.js --scope=canonical --require-verified-path=Operations/Runbooks --fail-on=tbd,wip --warn-on=todo`
- [ ] If entry scope has any missing links, fix immediately (no placeholders allowed).
- [ ] For canonical scope, follow the decision rules below.

### Suggested CI / Weekly Commands
- Entry gate (must be clean):
  - `node scripts/obsidian-tools/check-links.js --scope=entry --fail-on=entry`
- Canonical gate (ignore aspirational hubs):
  - `node scripts/obsidian-tools/check-links.js --scope=canonical --fail-on=canonical --ignore-file="Operations/Meta/DormWay Documentation Wiki.md" --gate-status=current`
- Canonical triage helper:
  - `node scripts/obsidian-tools/check-links.js --scope=canonical --report-untracked=25 --ignore-file="Operations/Meta/DormWay Documentation Wiki.md" --gate-status=current`

Flags:
- `--ignore-path=PATH` ignores a folder prefix for gating and untracked reporting.
- `--ignore-file=REL_PATH` ignores a specific file for gating and untracked reporting.
- `--append-intentional=N` appends top N untracked targets to the intentional tracker.
- `--gate-status=STATUS` limits canonical gating to docs with matching frontmatter status (e.g., `current`).

### Review Recent Changes
- [ ] Check files created/edited this week (use Obsidian recent files or git log)
- [ ] Verify new files have proper frontmatter (type, status, owner, tags)
- [ ] Ensure new files link from/to relevant section READMEs
- [ ] Check that cross-references are bidirectional where appropriate
- [ ] Only promote to `status: current` after verifying the doc against code/config; otherwise keep `status: draft` and add a short "Verification Needed" section.

### Archive Completed Work
- [ ] Move completed workplans to Archive/Workplans/
- [ ] Update feature status from "In Development" to "Active" upon launch
- [ ] Archive deprecated feature docs with redirect notices

### Quick Health Check
- [ ] Scan Daily Notes/ for any docs that should be Session Notes in Memory/
- [ ] Check if any large files (>1000 lines) should be split or archived
- [ ] Verify Templates/ haven't been modified accidentally

**Time Required**: ~5 minutes

---

## Link Triage Decision Rules

When a canonical link is missing:
- **Map-to-existing-doc**: use `scripts/obsidian-tools/map-missing-links.js` if the doc exists under a new name/path.
- **Create-anchor-doc**: only if the target appears multiple times and is clearly canonical (not a one-off idea).
- **Intentional placeholder**: log it in `DormWay/Operations/Meta/Intentional Missing Links.md` with owner + reason.

Do not create stubs for ticket IDs or one-off phrases.

---

## Monthly Tasks (30 minutes)

**Frequency**: First Monday of each month

### Content Staleness Review
- [ ] Generate report of files not modified in 60+ days
  - Use: `find obsidian-vault/DormWay -name "*.md" -mtime +60`

  - Still accurate?
  - Should be archived?
  - Needs deprecation notice?
  - Owner still correct?

### README Accuracy Check
- [ ] Review README.md files in major sections
- [ ] Update stats if significantly drifted (optional - can move to frontmatter)
- [ ] Ensure "Related Sections" links are current
- [ ] Check that "Key Documents" lists are relevant

### Duplicate Content Scan
- [ ] Search for common terms to find duplicate docs
- [ ] Merge duplicates or add cross-references
- [ ] Archive older/inferior versions

### Tag Hygiene
- [ ] Review tag usage across vault
- [ ] Consolidate similar tags (e.g., `#ios` vs `#iOS` vs `#mobile`)
- [ ] Update Tag glossary if one exists

**Time Required**: ~30 minutes

## Tools & Commands

### Obsidian Features
- **Graph View**: Visualize vault connections
- **Backlinks**: See what links to current doc
- **Unlinked Mentions**: Find potential links
- **Search**: Full-text search across vault
- **Rename**: Auto-updates all wiki links

### Export Script
```bash
.repos/dormway-platform/scripts/obsidian/export_obsidian_vault.sh \
  /Users/rileycrimmins/DormWay/dormway-beta-workspace/obsidian-vault/DormWay \
  /Users/rileycrimmins/DormWay/dormway-beta-workspace/OBSIDIAN_VAULT_EXPORT.txt
```

Generates:
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_EXPORT.txt` - Full export
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_EXPORT_outline.md` - Heading structure
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_EXPORT_key_sections.md` - Key sections only
- `OBSIDIAN_VAULT_EXPORT_file_index.csv` - File metrics

### Search Commands
```bash
# Find files modified in last 60 days
find obsidian-vault/DormWay -name "*.md" -mtime -60

# Find files NOT modified in last 60 days
find obsidian-vault/DormWay -name "*.md" -mtime +60

# Count files per directory
find obsidian-vault/DormWay -type d -exec sh -c 'echo "$(find "$1" -maxdepth 1 -name "*.md" | wc -l) $1"' _ {} \;

# Find large files (>100KB)
find obsidian-vault/DormWay -name "*.md" -size +100k

# Find files with no frontmatter
grep -L "^---" obsidian-vault/DormWay/**/*.md
```

## When Things Break

### Broken Links
**Problem**: Wiki links `Like This` break when files are renamed manually.

**Solution**:
1. ✅ **Prevention**: Always use Obsidian's rename feature (right-click → rename)
2. 🔧 **Fix**: Run "Check for broken links" in Obsidian
3. 📝 **Update**: Fix each link to point to new location or remove if file deleted

### Drift in READMEs
**Problem**: README says "42 files" but there are now 58 files.

**Solution**:
1. ✅ **Prevention**: Move stats to frontmatter or Meta/, keep READMEs evergreen
2. 🔧 **Fix**: Update stats during quarterly review
3. 📝 **Long-term**: Remove time-bound stats from READMEs entirely

### Duplicate Content
**Problem**: Same topic documented in 3 different places.

**Solution**:
1. ✅ **Prevention**: Search before creating new docs
2. 🔧 **Fix**: Choose canonical version, archive others, add cross-links
3. 📝 **Redirect**: Add notices in old locations pointing to new canonical doc

### Missing Frontmatter
**Problem**: New docs created without frontmatter.

**Solution**:
1. ✅ **Prevention**: Use Templates/ for all new docs
2. 🔧 **Fix**: Add frontmatter during weekly review
3. 📝 **Enforce**: Make frontmatter part of PR review checklist

## Key Principles

1. **Incremental > Big Bang**
   - Fix as you touch things
   - Don't force massive cleanup sessions
   - Small consistent effort compounds

2. **Automation Where Possible**
   - Use Obsidian's built-in tools
   - Leverage export scripts
   - Find commands for common tasks

3. **Prevention > Cure**
   - Use templates for consistency
   - Educate team on best practices
   - Make good habits easy

4. **Archive, Don't Delete**
   - Preserve institutional knowledge
   - You never know when you'll need it
   - Disk space is cheap, lost knowledge is expensive

5. **Link Hygiene**
   - Use Obsidian rename (never manual)
   - Check quarterly for broken links
   - Cross-link liberally but meaningfully

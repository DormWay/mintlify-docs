# Documentation Standards

This document defines naming conventions, formatting standards, and organizational principles for the DormWay Obsidian vault.

---

## Naming Conventions

### Session Notes
**Format**: `YYYY-MM-DD - Short Title.md`

**Examples**:
- `2025-11-16 - Timezone System Overhaul.md`
- `2025-08-17 - Syllabus Webviewer Mobile Optimizations.md`
- `2025-10-14 - Dashboard BFF Realtime Deltas.md`

**Best Practices**:
- Always use ISO 8601 date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Keep titles concise but descriptive
- Use Title Case for clarity

---

### Architecture Decisions
**Format**: `[Area] - [Topic].md` or `ADR-{number}-{Title}.md`

**Examples**:
- `API v2 Design - Resource-Oriented REST.md`
- `ADR-001-Widget-System.md`
- `Database - Context Hierarchy Design.md`

**Best Practices**:
- Use ADR prefix for formal Architecture Decision Records
- Include area/domain in filename for clarity
- Number ADRs sequentially for easy reference

---

### Work Plans
**Format**: `[Epic] - Workplan.md` or `[Epic] Work Plan.md`

**Examples**:
- `Journey Development Work Plan - StudentWatcher Simplification.md`
- `Context Prediction Web Adaptation Work Plan.md`
- `Canvas Integration - Workplan.md`

**Best Practices**:
- Lead with epic/feature name
- Use "Workplan" or "Work Plan" consistently
- Link to related feature specs

---

### Analyses
**Format**: `[Topic] Analysis.md` or `[Topic] - Analysis.md`

**Examples**:
- `Material Gaps Analysis - Sep 2025.md`
- `Term View analysis.md`
- `Widget Performance Analysis.md`

**Best Practices**:
- Include "Analysis" in filename
- Add date if time-sensitive
- Link to related features/architecture

---

### Features
**Format**: `[Feature Name].md` or use feature subdirectory with README

**Examples**:
- `Context System/README.md` (complex feature with subdirectory)
- `BrainGains.md` (simple feature doc)
- `Demo Mode/README.md` (feature subdirectory)

**Best Practices**:
- Use subdirectories for complex features (>5 related docs)
- Use single `.md` file for simple features
- Always include README.md as entry point in subdirectories

---

## Frontmatter Standards

All important documents should include YAML frontmatter for metadata and Dataview queries.

### Standard Frontmatter
```yaml
---
type: spec | adr | analysis | workplan | session-note | guide
status: current | deprecated | draft | archived
owner: {team-name}
last_reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD
tags: [tag1, tag2, tag3]
related:
  - Related Doc 1
  - Related Doc 2
verified:
  by: {name}
  date: YYYY-MM-DD
  against:
    - "path/to/source"
---
```

### Verification Policy
Docs marked `status: current` in `Operations/Runbooks/` must include the `verified` block above and be checked against the referenced sources. If not verified, keep `status: draft` and add a "Verification Needed" section.

### Verification Tokens
- `TBD` / `WIP` are not allowed in `status: current` docs.
- `TODO` is allowed when phrased as future work.

### Field Definitions

**type** - Document category:
- `spec` - Feature specifications
- `adr` - Architecture Decision Records
- `analysis` - Research and analysis
- `workplan` - Work planning documents
- `session-note` - Development session notes
- `guide` - How-to guides and runbooks

**status** - Current state:
- `current` - Current and maintained (gate uses this)
- `deprecated` - Superseded but kept for reference
- `draft` - Work in progress
- `archived` - Historical, not current

**owner** - Team or person responsible:
- Use team names: `Platform`, `iOS`, `AI`, `Design`
- Use person names for individual ownership
- Keep updated as ownership changes

**last_reviewed** - Date of last review:
- ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Update when content is reviewed/updated
- Helps identify stale content

**tags** - Categorization:
- Use consistent tag vocabulary
- Examples: `[feature, ios, backend, ai, architecture]`
- Enables Dataview queries and search

**related** - Cross-references:
- Link related documents
- Use wiki-link format: `Document Name`
- Helps with navigation and context

---

## File Organization

### Directory Structure Principles

1. **Use subdirectories for complex topics** (>5 related docs)
   - Create `Feature Name/` directory
   - Add `README.md` as entry point
   - Group related docs together

2. **Use README.md as entry points**
   - Every major directory has a README
   - README explains purpose, structure, key docs
   - README links to important content

3. **Archive old content instead of deleting**
   - Move to `Archive/` with appropriate subdirectory
   - Preserve institutional knowledge
   - Add redirect notice in original location if needed

4. **Cross-link related docs**
   - Use `Wiki Links` for references
   - Link bidirectionally when relevant
   - Create "Related Documentation" sections

---

## Content Standards

### Document Structure

Every document should follow this structure:

1. **Title & Purpose**
   - Clear H1 title
   - Brief purpose statement
   - Context for the document

2. **Executive Summary** (for complex docs)
   - 3-5 bullet points
   - Key takeaways
   - Quick overview

3. **Sections**
   - Use H2 for major sections
   - Use H3 for subsections
   - Keep hierarchy clear

4. **Code Examples**
   - Use syntax highlighting
   - Specify language: ` ```typescript `
   - Include context/explanation

5. **Diagrams** (when helpful)
   - Use Mermaid for architecture/flows
   - Keep diagrams simple and focused
   - Add explanatory text

6. **Cross-References**
   - Link related docs
   - Use "Related Documentation" section
   - Provide context for links

7. **Footer** (optional)
   - Last updated date
   - Owner
   - Next review date

---

## Documentation Lifecycle

DormWay documentation follows a standard lifecycle:

```
Problem/Opportunity
       ↓
[Analysis](/docs/research/analysis/readme)     ← Research, gap analysis, feasibility
       ↓
[Workplan](/docs/plans/workplan/readme)     ← Choose approach, sequence work
       ↓
[Features](/docs/product/features/readme)     ← Define spec, user stories
       ↓
[Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/readme)  ← Record structural decisions (if large)
       ↓
[Technical](/docs/engineering/technical/readme)   ← Implementation details, patterns
       ↓
[Memory](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)         ← Session notes showing how we got there
```

**Best Practice**: Link docs bidirectionally as you move through the flow.

---

## Templates

Use templates from [Templates/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) for consistent documentation:

- Feature.md - Feature specifications
- ADR.md - Architecture Decision Records
- Session-Note.md - Development session notes
- AI-Crew.md - AI crew specifications
- Workplan.md - Work planning documents

---

## Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks (5 minutes)
- [ ] Review files created/edited this week
- [ ] Ensure new files have frontmatter
- [ ] Ensure new files link from/to relevant sections
- [ ] Archive any completed work plans

### Monthly Tasks (30 minutes)
- [ ] Review content not updated in 60+ days
- [ ] Update README stats if they've drifted significantly
- [ ] Check for deprecated features to archive
- [ ] Scan for duplicate content

### Quarterly Tasks (2 hours)
- [ ] Run Obsidian "Check for broken links"
- [ ] Review all section READMEs for accuracy
- [ ] Update vault health metrics
- [ ] Archive content >6 months old if deprecated
- [ ] Review tag taxonomy and consolidate
- [ ] Update Templates/ if new patterns emerge

---

## Key Principles

1. **Evergreen Content**
   - Remove time-bound stats from core docs
   - Keep purpose and structure evergreen
   - Move stats to frontmatter or Meta/

2. **Template Discipline**
   - Use Templates/ for all new docs
   - Maintain consistency
   - Update templates as patterns evolve

3. **Link Hygiene**
   - Use Obsidian rename (auto-updates links)
   - Check quarterly for broken links
   - Cross-link liberally

4. **Archive, Don't Delete**
   - Preserve institutional knowledge
   - Move to Archive/ with context
   - Add redirect notices when needed

5. **Incremental > Perfect**
   - Fix as you touch things
   - Don't force big cleanup passes
   - Improve continuously

# Docs Ops Overview (Concise)

## What this is
The DormWay Obsidian vault lives in `obsidian-vault/DormWay` and is synced via Obsidian Sync. The vault is intentionally gitignored. Only docs tooling and workflows are committed to git.

## Trust model (where to rely)
Canonical buckets: `Engineering/`, `Product/`, `Plans/`, `Operations/`, `Research/`.
Non-canonical buckets: `Notes/`, `Generated/`, `Archive/`, `Templates/`, `Attachments/`.

If a doc is outside canonical buckets, treat it as non-canonical unless explicitly stated.

## Status policy
- `status: current` = reliable enough to depend on
- `status: draft` = in progress
- `status: deprecated` = superseded
- `status: archived` = historical snapshot
- Missing status = unknown trust

## Verification policy (precise)
- `TBD` / `WIP` are hard failures in any `status: current` doc.
- `Operations/Runbooks/**` requires a `verified:` block when `status: current`.
- Elsewhere, missing `verified:` metadata is a warning (not a failure).

## One command to run
```bash
make docs
```
Runs: `docs-health` (regen), `docs-verify`, `docs-entry`, `docs-canonical`, and writes JSON artifacts.

## Quick checks
```bash
make docs-status
make docs-next
```

## Gates (what they do)
- Entry gate: checks `Index.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `Changelog.md`, section READMEs, and `Generated/`.
- Canonical gate: `status: current` docs must have no *untracked* missing links.
- Verification gate: enforces rules above.

## Missing links
- Fix broken links or map renames via `scripts/obsidian-tools/map-missing-links.js`.
- Track intentional placeholders in `Operations/Meta/Intentional Missing Links.md`.
- Batch append: `make docs-append-intentional N=10`.

## Generated docs
Run `make docs-health`. Never edit `Generated/` manually.

## Where to start
- `Generated/Vault Home (Generated)`
- `Generated/Docs Health (Generated)`
- `Generated/MOC API (Generated)`, `MOC iOS (Generated)`, `MOC Web (Generated)`

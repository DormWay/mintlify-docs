# DormWay

DormWay is a context-aware student life platform launching at the University of Michigan on August 16, 2025.

## Vision

Help students navigate college life through intelligent, context-aware assistance powered by [AI](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/readme) and real-time [context awareness](/docs/engineering/architecture/sot-context-system).

## Core Components

### User-Facing
- iOS App - Primary interface (Swift/SwiftUI)
- Engineering/Technical/Widget System - Home screen intelligence
- Push Notifications - Smart alerts

### Backend Services
- [Making of DormWay - Obsidian Real-Time Collaboration Engine](/docs/product/go-to-market/making-of-dormway-obsidian-real-time-collaboration-engine) - Temporal-based workflow engine
- API Router - Express.js API gateway
- [Ably Relay](/docs/engineering/technical/integrations/ably-integration) - Real-time messaging
- BrainGains - AI study assistant

### Infrastructure
- Supabase - Authentication & database
- Temporal - Workflow orchestration
- Customer.io - Transactional messaging
- [Vectara](/docs/engineering/technical/integrations/vectara-integration) - RAG infrastructure

## Launch Focus

We're currently focused on [Operational Stability](/docs/plans/planning/operational-stability) for our [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys):

1. [Onboarding](/docs/product/features/onboarding/onboarding) - First user experience
2. Syllabus Loading - Document ingestion
3. [Calendar System](/docs/product/features/calendar-system) - Event synchronization
4. BrainGains - AI interactions
5. Daily Return - Ongoing engagement

See [Launch Plan](/docs/plans/planning/launch-plan) for timeline and [TODO List](/docs/plans/planning/todo-list) for current priorities.

## Operational Runbooks
- [PLG Spot Check](/docs/operations/runbooks/plg-spot-check) — Idempotent PLG cleanup, dry-run, syllabus reassignment
- [Syllabus Campus Linker](/docs/operations/runbooks/syllabus-campus-linker) — Inspect JSON/PDF, link campuses, registry dedupe

## Admin API References
- [Admin PLG Endpoints](/docs/engineering/technical/admin-plg-endpoints) — Cleanup/reassign/dry-run endpoints

## QA Plans
- [User Journeys QA Plan](/docs/plans/workplan/user-journeys-qa-plan) — End-to-end validation across PLG → reprocessing

## User Journeys
- [User Journeys](/docs/product/user-journeys) — Canonical flows from PLG through reprocessing

## Key Decisions

- **2025-07-11 Snap the Line** - Feature freeze for launch
- **Mobile-first** - iOS only at launch
- **University of Michigan** - Single campus launch
- **Syllabus-first GTM** - Lead with BrainGains

## Architecture

Built on modern, scalable architecture:
- Dependency Injection - No singletons
- Real-time Architecture - Event-driven
- Privacy First - User consent required
- Offline Support - Queue and sync

## Team

- Engineering: Building for [Operational Stability](/docs/plans/planning/operational-stability)
- Product: Focused on [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys)
- Business: Executing Go-to-Market Strategy

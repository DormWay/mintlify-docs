## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Plugin settings not loading?
```bash
# From vault root
git pull
# Then restart Obsidian
```

### Git not working?
1. Check Git is installed: `git --version`
2. Check authentication: `git remote -v`
3. Try manual commit: `git add . && git commit -m "test"`
4. Make sure you're in the right directory: `cd dormway/obsidian/DormWay`
5. The vault is a submodule, so commits go to the docs-obsidian repo

### Templates not applying?
1. Check Templater settings
2. Verify template folder is "Templates"
3. Check folder template mappings

## 🎯 Next Steps

Once setup is complete:
1. Create your first Daily Note
2. Explore the Product/Features folder

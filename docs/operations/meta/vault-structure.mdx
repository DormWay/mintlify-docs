│   Backlog   │ --> │   Sprint    │ --> │    Done     │
│  [Note 1]   │     │  [Note 2]   │     │  [Note 3]   │
│  [Note 4]   │     │  [Note 5]   │     │  [Note 6]   │
└─────────────┘     └─────────────┘     └─────────────┘
```

## 🔍 Using the Structure

### Benefits of Hierarchy + Links

1. **Best of Both Worlds**
   - Folders for high-level organization
   - Links for cross-cutting relationships
   - Tags for additional categorization

2. **Multiple Navigation Paths**
   - Browse by folder (temporal, functional)
   - Follow links (conceptual)
   - Search globally (keywords)
   - Query with Dataview (metadata)

3. **Flexible Organization**
   - Move notes between folders easily
   - Links remain intact
   - Can belong to multiple contexts via links

### Example Relationships

```
Daily Notes/2025-07-11.md
    └── links to → Planning/Sprint Goals.md
                          └── links to → Features/Calendar System.md
                                              └── links to → Architecture/EventKit.md
```

## 🚀 Migration Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Current/active docs only
   - Daily logs from last 2 weeks
   - Current sprint features
   - Active planning docs

2. **Phase 2**: Reference architecture
   - Technical designs
   - API documentation
   - Integration guides

3. **Phase 3**: Historical archive
   - Older daily logs
   - Completed features
   - Meeting notes

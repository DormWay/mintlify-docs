# Missing Documentation and Gaps

- Current stack one-pager (`Technical/Architecture/Current Stack.md`) summarizing the canonical choices: Temporal for orchestration (no cron), Portkey prompt registry (Helicone deprecated), Neon PostgreSQL (legacy Aurora naming in code), Next.js App Router for web UI, Zuplo + Clerk for edge/gateway. Should cite `Technical/Development Guides/DormWay Golden Paths.md`.
- Portkey + prompt registry golden path for LLM calls (activities, crews, @dormway/core) to replace Helicone snippets still present in Engine docs.
- Temporal scheduling guide that replaces cron schedules in sync orchestration docs (Production/Sync Orchestration Configuration, sync-orchestration-system) and aligns with worker health expectations.
- Gateway/source-of-truth note aligning Zuplo OAS with Express route inventory; clarify where to update routes vs gateway spec to avoid divergence.
- Short runbook for the new engineering harness (Safety/Evals/Temporal visibility) and `smart-run.sh`/obsidian-tools so agents know how to invoke it safely inside the vault.

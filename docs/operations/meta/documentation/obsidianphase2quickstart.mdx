# Obsidian Phase 2 - Quick Start (TL;DR)

**Read the full prompt**: `OBSIDIAN_PHASE_2_PROMPT.md`

## Context (1 sentence)
Phase 1 is done (health 37→65). Vault is now navigable. Phase 2 = incremental improvements for long-term maintainability.

## Week 1 Priorities (Do These First)

### 1. Create Start Here Index (30 min) ⭐⭐⭐
**File**: `obsidian-vault/DormWay/Index.md`
**Purpose**: Single entry point with vault map + task shortcuts
**Template**: See OBSIDIAN_PHASE_2_PROMPT.md section "Priority 1"

### 2. Move Meta Docs (10 min) ⭐⭐⭐
```bash
mkdir -p obsidian-vault/DormWay/Operations/Meta/Documentation
mv OBSIDIAN_PHASE_1_COMPLETE.md obsidian-vault/DormWay/Operations/Meta/Documentation/
mv OBSIDIAN_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md obsidian-vault/DormWay/Operations/Meta/Documentation/
```
Keep `OBSIDIAN_QUICK_START.md` at root.

### 3. Archive Giant Sample File (5 min) ⭐⭐
```bash
mkdir -p obsidian-vault/DormWay/Archive/Examples
mv "obsidian-vault/DormWay/Engineering/AI Crews/Semester Summary Sample.md" \
   "obsidian-vault/DormWay/Archive/Examples/Semester-Summary-Sample.md"
```
**Why**: 10,781 lines of JSON noise.

### 4. Extract Templates (20 min) ⭐⭐
**Create**: `Templates/` directory
**Files**: Feature.md, ADR.md, Session-Note.md, AI-Crew.md, Workplan.md
**Templates**: See OBSIDIAN_PHASE_2_PROMPT.md section "Priority 4"

## Week 2-3 (If Continuing)
- Add frontmatter to ~50 key docs
- Document naming conventions in Meta/
- Add decision flow diagram to Features/README

## Key Principles
1. **Evergreen READMEs** - Remove time-bound stats
2. **Template Discipline** - Use Templates/ for new docs
3. **Archive, Don't Delete** - Preserve knowledge
4. **Incremental > Perfect** - Fix as you touch things

## Success =
- Index.md exists
- Meta docs organized
- Templates extractable
- Sample file archived

**Total Week 1 Time**: ~65 minutes
**Impact**: Vault becomes self-documenting and easy to maintain long-term

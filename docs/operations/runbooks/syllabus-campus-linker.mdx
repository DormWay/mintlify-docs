# Syllabus Campus Linker (Admin)

Link courses/syllabi to campus contexts, inspect processed data, and fix mislinks efficiently.

## Verification Needed
- Confirm admin UI path and tab labels in current admin build.
- Confirm campus registry search behavior and creation guardrails.
- Confirm reassign behavior still updates `course.parent_id`.

## Where To Find
- Admin → Syllabus → Tabs → Campus Linker

## Capabilities
- Search/Filter syllabuses (user, course, term, campus).
- Preview JSON: in-row eye icon opens a structured preview dialog.
- Open PDF: download/original view for inspection.
- Link campus:
  - Existing campus contexts: pick from list (deduped).
  - Registry search: for lookup only. Creation flow is disabled in production; do not create new campuses from the registry.
  - Provisional flag supported.
- Reassign behavior (per-course): updates course.parent_id to campus.

## Dry Run + Dedupe
- Dedupes existing context lists client-side; keys unique.
- Creation from registry is currently disabled; use existing campus contexts only.
- Use PLG Spot Check’s dry run for syllabus moves (single and batch) when acting from that page.

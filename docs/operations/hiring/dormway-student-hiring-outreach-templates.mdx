## Direct Student Outreach Templates

### Template 1: Direct Message (Instagram/LinkedIn/Discord)
```
Hey [name],

I'm Riley—senior at UMich and co-founder of DormWay. We're live on 6200 campuses right now, and we're building new features literally every week based on what students tell us they need.

Saw your work on [specific project] and wanted to reach out. We need a [designer/email marketer] who can move fast—like, we built our last feature in a weekend fast.

Quick question: What's the last product that made you say "holy shit, everyone needs this"?

That's what we're trying to build for campus life, and we're doing it in real-time with students already using it. If you want to help build it (and see your work go live within days), I'd love to chat.

[calendar link or "lmk if interested"]

### Template 2: Design Community Post
```
Hey everyone,

I'm Riley, senior at UMich building DormWay—we're live on 6200 campuses and building features based on what students tell us they need, sometimes in a single weekend.

We need a student designer who can move at that pace.

Here's my favorite question: What's the last product that made you say "holy shit, everyone needs this"?

That's what we're building for campus life. Students are using it right now. Your designs would go live within days, not months.

If you have a good answer and want to be the one designing that kind of experience, DM me.

[Portfolio/work samples appreciated]

## Professor/Program Head Outreach

### Template 3: Email to Design Professors

**Subject**: Need student designer for live product—6200 campuses, shipping weekly
```
Hi Professor [name],

I'm Riley Crimmins—senior at University of Michigan and co-founder of DormWay. We're live on 6200 campuses right now and building features in real-time based on student feedback.

We need a student designer who can move fast. Last weekend we shipped a new feature from idea to production. That's the pace we're working at.

**What we're looking for:**
- Student designer who's comfortable shipping to production
- Someone who can iterate quickly on a live product
- Designer who wants to see their work used by thousands of students within days

**What they'd be doing:**
- Designing features that ship this week, not next quarter
- Owning design system for iOS/web
- Working directly with founders (I'm a student, my co-founder Ethan has 30 years consumer tech experience)
- Rapid iteration based on real user feedback

**Compensation**: $30-40/hr, 10-20 hrs/week, flexible around classes

One thing I always ask: "What's the last product that made you say 'holy shit, everyone needs this'?" We're looking for someone with strong opinions about what makes products essential.

If you have a student who thrives in fast-moving environments and wants to build for a live audience, I'd appreciate an intro.

Thanks,
Riley Crimmins
Senior, University of Michigan
riley@dormway.app

P.S. DormWay is at dormway.app if you want to see what we're building

### Template 4: Email to Marketing/Communications Professors

**Subject**: Looking for student email marketer—live product, 6200 campuses
```
Hi Professor [name],

I'm Riley Crimmins, senior at University of Michigan and co-founder of DormWay. We're live on 6200 campuses right now and scaling rapidly.

We're looking for a student (or recent grad) to own our email marketing and student communications. Not an internship where they write subject lines—they'd be building the entire email system for a live product with real users.

**What we're looking for:**
- Student who writes like a human, not a marketing robot
- Someone who understands what college students actually read
- Experience with email tools (or quick learner)
- Comfortable moving fast on live campaigns

**What they'd be doing:**
- Building onboarding flows, lifecycle campaigns, feature announcements
- Owning Customer.io and Postmark infrastructure
- Writing copy that doesn't make people immediately unsubscribe
- A/B testing and optimization for active users

**Compensation**: $25-35/hr, 8-15 hrs/week

I always ask candidates: "What's the last product that made you say 'holy shit'?" We need someone who knows what makes people genuinely excited about a product vs. just tolerating it.

If you have a standout student who might be interested, I'd love an intro.

Thanks,
Riley Crimmins
Senior, University of Michigan
riley@dormway.app

P.S. Happy to come speak to your class about student entrepreneurship or product marketing if that's ever useful

```
I'm Riley, senior at UMich and co-founder of DormWay. We're live on 6200 campuses, and we need someone to own our email system while we're rapidly scaling.

**What's the last product that made you say "holy shit"?**

DM me or riley@dormway.app

## Interview Screening Questions

### The Core Filter Question

**"What's the last product that made you say 'holy shit, everyone needs this'?"**

**What you're listening for:**
- Specific product with thoughtful reasoning
- Can articulate *why* it created that reaction
- Focuses on experience/value, not just features
- Shows they think about product quality

**Red flags:**
- Generic answer ("Instagram because everyone uses it")
- Can't name anything specific
- Describes features, not the "holy shit" moment
- No genuine enthusiasm

---

### Follow-up Questions by Role

#### For Designers:

1. "We shipped a new feature last weekend. If I gave you a feature spec on Monday, could you have designs ready by Friday?"

2. "What's one thing about DormWay's current design that you'd change immediately?"
   *(Show them the app first)*

3. "Show me the best UI component you've ever designed and tell me why it works"

4. "How do you feel about iterating on live features based on user feedback?"

5. "If you were designing our app icon, what would make students actually want it on their home screen?"

#### For Email/Marketing:

1. "We're launching a new feature Tuesday. It's Thursday now. Can you write and schedule the announcement email by Monday?"

2. "What's the last marketing email you actually opened and why?"

3. "How would you convince a skeptical student that DormWay isn't just another campus app?"

4. "What's your process for writing fast without sacrificing quality?"

5. "Write me the subject line for our launch announcement email right now"

#### For Content Creators:

1. "Show me your favorite piece of content you've made that totally flopped. What did you learn?"

2. "What's one TikTok/Reel about a product that you remember months later? Why?"

3. "How would you show someone DormWay's value in 15 seconds?"

4. "We just shipped a feature that's getting mixed feedback. How would you document that?"

## Key Messaging Points (What Riley Should Emphasize)

### What Makes This Different:

- "We're not pre-launch—students are using this right now"
- "Last weekend we went from idea to shipped feature"
- "You'll see your work go live within days, sometimes hours"
- "We're building based on what students tell us, not what we think they need"
- "6200 campuses are live right now—your work impacts real users immediately"

### What You're Looking For:

- Comfort with ambiguity and rapid iteration
- Someone who ships and learns vs. perfects and launches
- Designer/marketer who wants feedback loop measured in days, not quarters
- Student who understands campus life because they're living it right now
- Person who gets excited about building in public and moving fast

### Red Flags to Watch For:

- "I need to fully understand the roadmap before starting"
- "I usually take 2-3 weeks per design cycle"
- "I prefer having everything planned out in advance"
- Can't show examples of iterative work or fast turnarounds
- Uncomfortable with the idea of changing things after they're live
- Needs extensive onboarding before producing work

## Notes for Riley

- Lead with student-to-student authenticity (you're a senior, not a CEO in a suit)
- Emphasize the "building in public" and rapid iteration aspect
- The "holy shit" question is the filter—pay close attention to answers
- Look for people who are excited about the pace, not scared of it
- Prioritize students who are currently on campus and understand the problem
- Be transparent about the work style: fast, iterative, real-time feedback
- Don't oversell—right person will be excited by the challenge, not the pitch

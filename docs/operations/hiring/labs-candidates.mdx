Here is the revised Primary Cohort (Top 10). I have removed the "over-tailored" candidates and replaced them with students whose experience is grounded in verifiable, past employment or distinct projects that naturally align with the role.

Revised Primary Cohort (Top 10)
1. Kamar S. Alsamerraey (Merrimack College)

Role: QA Lead / Edge Case Specialist
Why: A former school teacher turned QA tester. This is a powerful combination for DormWay. They have real experience with Testbirds and uTest (professional crowd-testing platforms), meaning they know how to follow test scripts and document bugs. As a former teacher, they actually understand syllabi and academic workflows better than any engineering student.
2. Emmanuel Akeh (BYU Idaho)

Role: Stress Tester
Why: Currently working as a Quality Assurance Analyst for a game studio (TwinRayJ). Game testing is repetitive, rigorous, and requires spotting visual/logic glitches that break immersion. He lists "documenting 50+ reproducible bug reports," which is the exact metric (reproducibility) needed for the engineering team.
3. Jue (Jess) Wu (Northeastern University)

Role: iOS Technical Lead
Why: Replaces Abdul as the iOS expert. Deep experience in the Apple ecosystem, specifically VisionOS and iOS development (Swift/SwiftUI). They have managed TestFlight deployments, meaning they understand the beta-testing lifecycle and how to pull crash logs from iPhones, which is critical for the "iOS 17+" requirement.
4. Jose Pietri (Arizona State University)

Role: Domain Expert (Scheduling Logic)
Why: Built a Java-based "Automated Class Scheduler" that parsed student preference records from Excel. He has already solved the "nasty" part of this problem—logic conflicts and parsing data. He isn't testing the UI; he is testing the scheduling algorithm.
5. Sergiy Maltsev (Washington State University - Everett)

Role: Data Integrity / Syllabus Validation
Why: Currently working at DataAnnotation.tech. This job requires extreme attention to detail and adherence to strict guidelines when labeling data. This makes him the perfect candidate to review the "50+ syllabus formats" mentioned in the JD without getting bored or sloppy.
6. Fatima H. Algahaim (Wayne State University)

Role: iOS / UX Tester
Why: Participant in the MSU Apple Foundation Program, giving her verified training in iOS standards. She combines technical Swift knowledge with a focus on accessibility and UI flow, which is vital for a student-facing app.
7. Abdul Majid (CSU San Marcos)

Role: Support & Triage
Why: Experience in Tier 1 & Tier 2 technical support at Millennium Health. He is used to looking at error logs ("SQL queries") and translating user complaints into technical tickets. He fits the "Help Us Hit 0 Critical Issues" goal by acting as the filter between user reports and engineers.
8. Tammie Chen (UC Irvine)

Role: Usability & Grunt Work
Why: A mix of Data Entry Clerk (Medical Group) and UX Designer. The Data Entry experience proves she can handle the tedious task of verifying hundreds of syllabus dates, while the UX background allows her to provide the "plain-language feedback" requested in the JD.
9. Afsheen Mohammad (Georgia Tech)

Role: Test Automation
Why: Test Engineer Intern at Gaming Laboratories International. She wrote Python scripts to automate game outcome testing. If DormWay needs to run regression passes (repeatedly testing the same flow), she can likely script the boring parts so the team can focus on edge cases.
10. David Tran (Virginia Tech)

Role: Security & Privacy
Why: The JD explicitly asks for "Privacy-minded." David is a Cybersecurity major with internships at GuidePoint Security and Ernst & Young. He is the best candidate to stress-test the app for data leaks (e.g., "Can I see another student's schedule?") before launch.
Backup Cohort (Next 10)
These candidates are strong but either lack the specific "QA/Testing" professional experience or have slightly less relevant domain expertise than the top 10.

Claire Cao (Barnard/Columbia) – Strong PM intern with QA experience, but the top 10 have more hands-on "grunt work" testing experience.
Riyash Patel (Rutgers) – Strong technical skills, but his cover letter/resume felt slightly over-tailored to the "AI" aspect rather than the "shipping/testing" aspect.
Troy Corbitt (Cornell) – Good Customer Experience background (churn analysis), useful for identifying user frustration.
Alvin Lian (Stony Brook) – Solid iOS builder ("TripHelper"), good technical backup.
Hanna Berhane (U of Tampa) – ITS Service Desk Supervisor; good at handling high-volume user issues.
Michael Nguyen (George Mason) – Built educational platforms ("WebStraw"), understands the EdTech space.
Shubham Mital (UIUC) – Fixed "high-impact iOS layout issues" at Disney. Very strong technical polish.
Catalina Giang (Columbia) – Product intern who did usability testing; good for UI feedback.
Aaron Zheng (UPitt) – Built an iOS app ("Classical Conditioning"); competent generalist.
Isabella DiMarino (U of Miami) – "Customer Service Professional" (Barista/Retail). High tolerance for chaos and people work, though less technical than the others.

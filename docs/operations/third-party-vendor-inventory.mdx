## DPA Priority Tiers

### Tier 1 - Critical (Direct Student Data)
These vendors have direct access to student educational records under FERPA:

1. **Neon** - Primary data store for all student information
2. **Canvas LMS** - Academic records, grades, assignments
3. **OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini** - Process student content through AI
4. **Clerk** - Authentication and user identity
5. **Customer.io** - Behavioral tracking and push notifications

### Tier 2 - High (Significant Data Exposure)
These vendors receive meaningful student data:

- **Ably** - Real-time notifications with user context
- **Zuplo** - All API traffic passes through gateway
- **Temporal** - Workflow state includes student/campus IDs
- **Google Maps API** - Location data
- **AWS S3** - Student-uploaded files (syllabi)
- **Amplitude** - User analytics events

### Tier 3 - Medium (Partial/Indirect Exposure)
These vendors may receive limited or anonymized data:

- **Helicone** - LLM request logging
- **Sentry** - Error context may include user IDs
- **Dash0** - System logs and traces
- **IPInfo** - IP-based geolocation
- **Ragie** - Document content parsing

### Tier 4 - Low (Infrastructure Only)
Minimal direct student data exposure:

- **Supabase** - iOS device authentication
- **Trigger.dev** - Job scheduling
- **Browser Use / AgentQL** - Web scraping utilities
- **Google Sign-In** - OAuth flow only

## Data Types by Vendor

| Vendor | Emails | Names | Grades | Courses | Location | Behavior | Content |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|---------|----------|----------|---------|
| Neon | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Canvas LMS | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | | | |
| Clerk | ✓ | ✓ | | | | | |
| Customer.io | ✓ | | | | | ✓ | |
| OpenAI/Anthropic | | | | ✓ | | | ✓ |
| Ably | | | | | | ✓ | |
| Google Maps | | | | | ✓ | | |
| Amplitude | | | | | | ✓ | |

## Next Steps

- [ ] Audit each Tier 1 vendor's existing DPA/BAA status
- [ ] Request DPAs from vendors without agreements
- [ ] Review data retention policies for each vendor
- [ ] Document data flows for FERPA compliance audit
- [ ] Implement data minimization where possible

## Notes

- **FERPA**: 17 vendors receive student educational records or PII
- **No payment processing** identified (Stripe not in active use)
- **Auth0** appears in legacy code but Clerk is primary auth provider

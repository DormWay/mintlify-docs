Canonical technical documentation: architecture, implementation, APIs, infrastructure, and system internals.

## Start Here
- [Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/readme) - system decisions and high-level design.
- [Technical](/docs/engineering/technical/readme) - implementation details and how-to guides.
- [Beta Page Map (LockedIn)](/docs/engineering/architecture/beta-page-map-lockedin) - beta navigation contract for the student web app.
- [AI Crews](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) - AI/ML agent specifications.
- Widget System Architecture - widget system overview.
- [Dashboard Intelligence](/docs/engineering/dashboard-intelligence/readme) - dashboards and intelligence features.

## What Belongs Here
- System architecture, APIs, database, workflows, and infrastructure.
- Implementation guides, integration docs, and engineering standards.

## What Does Not Belong Here
- Product strategy, GTM, or design direction (move to `Product/`).
- Meeting notes, worklogs, or scratch notes (move to `Notes/`).

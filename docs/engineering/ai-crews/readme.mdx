# AI Crews

## Purpose
This section contains specifications for DormWay's AI crews - intelligent agent systems powered by CrewAI that process student data, analyze contexts, and generate insights.

## Structure
Crew documentation is organized by crew type and function, with each crew having detailed specifications for agents, tasks, and outputs.

## Active Crews

### Student Intelligence & Planning
- Student Daily Intelligence Crew - Daily student intelligence generation and planning
- Study Planning & Health Wellness Crews - Study planning and wellness recommendations
- [Full Workload Analysis Crew](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/full-workload-analysis-crew) - Comprehensive workload analysis

### Context Processing
- [Deep Context Analysis Crew](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/deep-context-analysis-crew) - Deep analysis of academic contexts
- (Campus Context Crew - if exists)
- (City Context Crew - if exists)

### Semester & Academic Planning
- [Semester Analysis Crew](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/semester-analysis-crew) - Semester-level academic analysis
- [Semester Analysis & Periodic Crews](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/semester-analysis-periodic-crews) - Periodic semester analysis
- [Semester Planning Prompts](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/semester-planning-prompts) - Prompts for semester planning
- [Semester Planning Rework Summary](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/semester-planning-rework-summary) - Semester planning system rework
- Semester Summary Sample - Example semester summary output

### Widget & Data Processing
- Widget Conformance Agent - Ensures widget data conforms to specifications

## Crew Architecture

### Core Architecture
- [Crew Architecture Refactor](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/crew-architecture-refactor) - Crew architecture refactoring documentation
- [Crew Input Specifications for Temporal Integration](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/crew-input-specifications-for-temporal-integration) - Integration with Temporal workflows
- CrewAI Knowledge and Memory Implementation - Knowledge and memory systems

### CrewAI Framework
DormWay uses **CrewAI** for agent orchestration (migrated July 2025).

**Key Components**:
- **Agents**: Specialized AI agents with specific roles and capabilities
- **Tasks**: Defined work units with inputs, outputs, and dependencies
- **Crews**: Orchestrated groups of agents working together
- **Tools**: External capabilities agents can invoke
- **Memory**: Short-term and long-term memory for context preservation

## How Crews Work

### Execution Flow
1. **Trigger**: Temporal workflow triggers crew execution
2. **Input Preparation**: Gather student data, contexts, materials
3. **Agent Orchestration**: CrewAI coordinates agents to complete tasks
4. **Task Execution**: Agents process data using LLMs and tools
5. **Output Generation**: Structured outputs (JSON, markdown)
6. **Storage**: Results saved to database
7. **Event Emission**: Real-time updates via Ably

### Crew Pattern
```python
# Example crew structure
class StudentDailyIntelligenceCrew:
    agents:
      - context_analyzer: Analyzes student's academic contexts
      - schedule_planner: Plans daily schedule
      - insight_generator: Generates insights and recommendations

    tasks:
      - analyze_contexts: Identify active contexts
      - plan_day: Create optimized day plan
      - generate_insights: Produce actionable insights

    output:
      - day_plan: Structured daily plan
      - insights: List of insights
      - recommendations: Personalized recommendations
```

## Crew Execution

### Scheduling
Crews are executed on schedules via Temporal workflows:
- **Daily Crews**: Run at 05:00 campus local time
- **Weekly Crews**: Run Sunday evenings
- **Semester Crews**: Run at semester start/midpoint/end
- **Event-Driven**: Triggered by specific events (syllabus upload, assignment created)

### Performance
- **Execution Time**: 30 seconds - 5 minutes per crew
- **LLM Calls**: 5-20 LLM calls per crew execution
- **Cost**: $0.10 - $1.00 per execution (varies by crew complexity)

## Crew Development

### Creating a New Crew
1. Define crew purpose and outputs
2. Design agents and their roles
3. Specify tasks and dependencies
4. Implement in `dormway-crews` service
5. Integrate with Temporal workflow
6. Document in this section

### Crew Documentation Template
```markdown
# {Crew Name}

## Purpose
{What this crew does and why}

## Agents
- **{Agent Name}**: {Role and responsibilities}

## Tasks
1. **{Task Name}**: {What it does}
   - Input: {Required data}
   - Output: {Produced data}

## Execution
- **Trigger**: {When/how it runs}
- **Frequency**: {How often}
- **Duration**: {Typical execution time}

## Outputs
{Structured output schema}

## Related Documentation
- Implementation: `dormway-crews/src/crews/{crew_name}.py`
- Workflow: Engineering/Technical/Engine/{workflow_name}
```

## Crew Testing

### Local Testing
```bash
# In dormway-crews service
python -m crews.student_daily_intelligence \
  --student-id 123 \
  --date 2025-11-16
```

### Integration Testing
Crews are tested via Temporal workflow integration tests in `dormway-platform`.

## Crew Monitoring

### Metrics to Track
- Execution success rate
- Average execution time
- LLM token usage and cost
- Output quality (human evaluation)
- Error rates by failure type

### Debugging Crews
- Check Temporal workflow execution logs
- Review crew execution traces
- Inspect LLM prompts and responses
- Validate input data quality

## Maintenance
- **Owner**: AI/ML Team
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16
- **Review Frequency**: Monthly for active crews, quarterly for deprecated crews
- **Update Policy**: All crew changes should update this documentation

# Semester Analysis Crew

## Overview
The Semester Analysis Crew processes multiple syllabi and schedule data to provide comprehensive semester-wide insights and strategic planning for students. It runs periodically as new syllabi or documents are added.

## Core Purpose
Transform fragmented course information into a unified, intelligent command center that helps students:
- Identify and prevent deadline collisions
- Optimize workload distribution
- Make strategic academic decisions
- Maintain wellness while maximizing performance

## Input Data
```python
{
    "user_id": "string",
    "syllabi": [
        # Multiple processed syllabus outputs from syllabus_processor crew
    ],
    "schedule": {
        # Class schedule from iOS app (if available)
        "monday": [...],
        "tuesday": [...],
        # etc.
    },
    "user_profile": {
        "major": "string",
        "year": "freshman|sophomore|junior|senior",
        "work_hours": 0-40,  # Part-time job hours
        "preferences": {...}
    },
    "braingains_documents": [
        # Additional documents that might affect schedule
    ]
}
```

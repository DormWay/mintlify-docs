# Security Architecture

Canonical reference for DormWay security architecture and threat posture.

## Scope
- Identity and authentication boundaries (Clerk, gateway headers, app auth)
- Authorization and data access (RLS, service roles, tenant boundaries)
- Secrets management and environment isolation
- Data protection (PII handling, encryption, retention)
- Audit logging and incident response expectations

## Notes
- Link key implementation references once validated.
- Track legacy auth paths here until fully removed.

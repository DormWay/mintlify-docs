# Architecture Doc Ownership & Sources of Truth

## Canonical Sources
- Dashboard BFF v1 behavior (snapshot, ETag, Redis, deltas):
  - `dormway-platform/services/api-router/docs/bff-dashboard-v1.md:11`
  - `dormway-platform/services/api-router/docs/realtime-dashboard-deltas.md:8`
- API implementations and references:
  - Routes: `dormway-platform/services/api-router/src/routes/dashboard-routes.ts:200`
  - ETag: `dormway-platform/services/api-router/src/utils/canonical-etag.ts:1`
  - Deltas publisher: `dormway-platform/services/api-router/src/services/ably-service.ts:131`

## Obsidian Guidance
- Obsidian pages summarize intent and high-level design. For implementation specifics, prefer the repo docs above.
- When BFF or delta semantics change, update the repo docs first; then mirror the summary here.

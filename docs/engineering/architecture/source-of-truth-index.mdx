# Source of Truth Index

This index lists the **Source of Truth (SoT)** docs that act as the canonical, verifiable contract for DormWay systems. These are not exhaustive textbooks. They are concise, validated references used for onboarding, debugging, and preventing regressions.

<Note>
**When in doubt, the SoT doc is authoritative.** If you find conflicts between a SoT doc and other documentation, the SoT doc wins.
</Note>

## Rules

1. Keep the SoT set small (14-16 docs)
2. Each SoT doc must list key files and invariants
3. When a change touches a domain, update its SoT doc
4. Do not create parallel TLDR folders

## How to Update a SoT Doc

Each SoT doc should include:

1. **Scope and non-goals** - What this doc covers and what it doesn't
2. **Invariants and contracts** - What must not break
3. **Key flows** - High-level system flows
4. **Key files** - Code paths and doc paths
5. **Update checklist** - Steps to update this doc
6. **Recent changes** - Changelog

### Update Process

When touching a domain:

1. Update the SoT doc for that domain
2. Add file paths in the "Key Files" section
3. Add a short entry to "Recent Changes"
4. Update `last_updated` frontmatter
5. If a plan doc is created, add a vault stub and update Plans index

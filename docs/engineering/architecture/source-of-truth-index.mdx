# Source of Truth Index

This index lists the small set of "Source of Truth" (SoT) docs that act as the canonical, verifiable contract for DormWay systems. These are not exhaustive textbooks. They are concise, validated references used for onboarding, debugging, and preventing regressions.

Rules:
- Keep the SoT set small (8-12 docs).
- Each SoT doc must list key files and invariants.
- When a change touches a domain, update its SoT doc.
- Do not create parallel TLDR folders.

## How to Update a SoT Doc

Each SoT doc should include:
- Scope and non-goals
- Invariants and contracts (what must not break)
- Key flows (high-level)
- Key files (code + docs)
- Update checklist
- Recent changes

When touching a domain:
1) Update the SoT doc for that domain.
2) Add file paths in the "Key Files" section.
3) Add a short entry to "Recent Changes".
4) Update `last_updated`.
5) If a plan doc is created, add a vault stub and update `Plans/INDEX.md`.

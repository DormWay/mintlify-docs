# Beta Page Map (LockedIn)

This is the single contract for beta-visible navigation and minimum page behavior in the LockedIn student web app.

- Source of truth (workspace root): `docs/beta-page-map.md`
- IA + contracts: `services/dormway-lockedin/docs/LOCKEDIN_IA_AND_CONTRACTS.md`

If code and docs conflict, code wins and the map must be updated within 24 hours.

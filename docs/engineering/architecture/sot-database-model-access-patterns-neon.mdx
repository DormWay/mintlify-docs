# SoT - Database Model & Access Patterns (Neon)

## Scope
- PostgreSQL connectivity and pooling for platform services (Neon via `DATABASE_URL` and admin via `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN`).
- Core adapters/wrappers used by api-router and engine for DB access and RLS session handling.
- Canonical tables/views referenced across services (contexts graph, service_data, schedule/time blocks, materialized views).
- Migration runner and tracking contracts.

## Non-goals
- Full schema or column-level documentation for every table.
- Data model or feature behavior outside DB access contracts.
- Infra provisioning details for Neon or Supabase services.

## Invariants & Contracts
- Core Postgres adapter requires `DATABASE_URL` with `postgres://` or `postgresql://` and uses a pooled connection (default max 20, 30s idle, 2s connect timeout).
- SSL is auto-detected: Neon/Railway hosts use `rejectUnauthorized: false`, local hosts disable SSL, other hosts use standard SSL.
- RLS session queries set `app.current_user_id`, `app.current_role`, and optional `app.current_context_id` via `SET LOCAL` inside a transaction; roles are limited to `authenticated`, `admin`, `demo`, `service`.
- api-router standard pool uses `DATABASE_URL` (RLS enforced); admin pool uses `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` to bypass RLS and falls back to standard pool if not configured.
- engine uses `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` (RLS bypass) with fallback to `DATABASE_URL`.
- Supabase client is still used for some tables (e.g., `user_devices`, `app_device_tokens`) via `SUPABASE_URL` + service role key.
- Migration runner uses Neon connection strings (prefers `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN`) and records applied migrations in `migration_history` with checksums.
- Adapter migration status checks default core tables: `accounts`, `roles`, `contexts`, `external_services`, `config`, `accounts_memberships`, `role_permissions`, `user_preferences`.
- Dashboard MV access is gated by `DASHBOARD_USE_MV`; when enabled it queries `mv_recent_assignments`, `mv_recent_schedule`, and `mv_dayplan_blocks`, otherwise falls back to `service_data`.

## Key Flows (High-Level)

### API Router DB Access

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Router as API Router
    participant Pool as getAuroraPool
    participant Client as aurora-client
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Router->>Pool: Get connection
    Pool->>Client: queryWithSession()
    Client->>DB: SET LOCAL app.current_user_id
    Client->>DB: SET LOCAL app.current_role
    Client->>DB: Execute query
    DB-->>Router: Result
```

### Admin DB Access

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin as Admin Routes
    participant Pool as getAdminPool
    participant DB as PostgreSQL (Admin)

    Admin->>Pool: Get admin connection
    Pool->>DB: Connect via DATABASE_URL_ADMIN
    Note over DB: RLS bypassed
    Admin->>DB: Execute query
    DB-->>Admin: Result
```

### Engine DB Access

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Engine
    participant Factory as DatabaseServiceFactory
    participant Aurora as AuroraService
    participant Pool as Core Adapter Pool
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Engine->>Factory: Get database service
    Factory->>Aurora: Create AuroraService
    Aurora->>Pool: Get connection
    Pool->>DB: Execute query
    DB-->>Engine: Result
```

### Legacy Supabase Interfaces

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Caller as Legacy Supabase Call
    participant Adapter as SupabaseAdapter
    participant Factory as DatabaseServiceFactory
    participant Pool as Shared Pool
    participant DB as PostgreSQL

    Caller->>Adapter: Call legacy method
    Adapter->>Factory: Get database service
    Factory->>Pool: Reuse shared pool
    Pool->>DB: Execute query
    DB-->>Caller: Result
```

### Dashboard Materialized View Queries

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Dashboard MV query] --> B{MV available?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Query materialized views]
    B -->|No| D[Fallback to service_data]
    C --> E[Return result]
    D --> E
```

### Database Migrations

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Script as run-migrations.sh
    participant DB as PostgreSQL
    participant FS as Filesystem

    Script->>DB: Check migration_history
    DB-->>Script: Applied migrations list
    Script->>FS: Read infrastructure/database/migrations/
    FS-->>Script: Pending SQL files
    loop Each pending migration
        Script->>DB: Apply SQL migration
        Script->>DB: Update migration_history
    end
    DB-->>Script: Migration complete
```

## Data Models / IDs / Terminology
- `contexts` and `context_dependencies`: canonical context graph tables referenced by api-router and engine.
- `service_data`: canonical ingestion/output store keyed by `method` and `fetched_at`.
- `time_blocks` and `student_time_blocks`: schedule/time block contracts used for dashboard and reminders.
- `engine_user_notification_preferences`: notification channel and quiet-hours preferences used by engine.
- `app_device_tokens` and `user_devices`: device token storage (queried via Supabase client).
- `migration_history`: migration tracking table used by the migration runner.
- Materialized views: `mv_recent_assignments`, `mv_recent_schedule`, `mv_dayplan_blocks`.

## Key Files (Code + Docs)

- `services/shared/dormway-core/src/adapters/database/types.ts` (SessionContext roles, adapter contract)

- `services/api-router/src/services/aurora-client.ts` (RLS session queries, legacy wrapper)
- `services/api-router/src/services/amplitude-trait-service.ts` (time_blocks access for schedule traits)
- `services/engine/src/services/auroraDb.ts` (engine pool, admin connection selection)
- `services/engine/src/services/database.ts` (DatabaseServiceFactory -> AuroraService)
- `services/engine/src/services/supabaseAdapter.ts` (legacy Supabase interface over Aurora)
- `services/api-router/src/services/supabase-client.ts` + `services/api-router/src/config/index.ts` (Supabase service role client)
- `services/api-router/src/services/dashboard-mv-queries.ts` (materialized view access + service_data fallback)
- `scripts/database/run-migrations.sh` + `infrastructure/database/migrations/` (migration runner + SQL source)

## Update Checklist
- Adding or changing schema: add SQL in `infrastructure/database/migrations`, run `scripts/database/run-migrations.sh`, and ensure `migration_history` tracking stays intact.
- Adding a new RLS-sensitive query: use `queryWithSession()` and ensure the session variables are set for the role you expect.
- Changing admin access rules: update `DATABASE_URL_ADMIN` usage in `services/api-router/src/services/auroraDb.ts` and `services/engine/src/services/auroraDb.ts`.
- Adding a new materialized view for dashboard: add migration + update `dashboard-mv-queries.ts` fallback logic.
- Changing DB connection behavior/SSL: update `postgres.adapter.ts` and `connection-manager.ts`.

## Recent Changes

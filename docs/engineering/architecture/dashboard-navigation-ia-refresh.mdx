# DormWay Dashboard Navigation Refresh (Widgets + Academic/Term Integration)

> Status: Draft – align IA with in-flight widget home and keep Schedule first-class

## Goals
- Consolidate Academic, Term/Syllabus, and Course views under one hierarchy.
- Ship widget-first Home without losing direct access to Academic, Schedule, Ace, and Integrations.
- Preserve Schedule as a standalone destination.
- Keep Integrations as a system/settings surface (not part of Ace).

## Proposed IA (desktop + mobile)
- Home (widgets)
- Academic (Term landing → Course drill-downs; workstation tabs)
- Schedule (kept as-is, add deep links from widgets/Academic)
- Ace (Chat/PadLock/Locker/Notes)
- Messages (optional full view; Inbox still has a Home widget)
- Integrations (system/settings)
- Profile/Settings

**Mobile bottom nav:** Home, Academic, Schedule, Ace, Messages (optional), More (Integrations/Settings).

## Home (widget-first)
- Inbox widget → Messages page.
- Tasks/Assignments widget → Academic (Assignments tab) and Schedule (for time blocking).
- Academic snapshot widget → Academic Term landing and course-specific views.
- Ace quick-notes/locker widget → Ace hub.
- Keep padding for bottom nav; respect safe areas.

## Academic (unify Term + Courses)
- Make Term view the Academic landing (reuse `SyllabusTermView` logic).
- Course drill-downs live inside Academic (merge syllabus data + Academic Intelligence signals).
- Retain workstation tabs (Assignments, Courses, Gradebook, Policies, Timeline) fed by the unified data.
- Deprecate separate `/dashboard/syllabus`; redirect into Academic with `?tab=`/anchors.

## Schedule
- Remains first-class in nav and mobile bottom nav.
- Widgets deep-link to specific days/weeks/slots.

## Ace (no Integrations)
- Scope to Chat, PadLock, Locker/Notes.
- Provide Home widget for quick add/view; full management in the Ace page.

## Integrations
- Stay under system/settings (and “More” on mobile). Not part of Ace.
- Home/Academic widgets can link here for connection prompts.

## Nav implementation deltas
- Update `DashboardSidebar`/`BottomNavigation` items: Home, Academic, Schedule, Ace, Messages (optional), More/Settings (with Integrations). Remove standalone Notes entry (covered by Ace).
- Add a Settings entry that surfaces Integrations.

## Migration steps
1) Build Home widget shells (Inbox, Tasks/Assignments, Academic snapshot, Ace quick-notes) with deep links to canonical pages.
2) Move `/dashboard/syllabus` content into Academic; make Term the landing, Courses the drill-down; set redirects.
3) Keep Schedule intact; add deep-link targets from widgets and Academic.
4) Update nav components and mobile bottom nav to new pillar set; ensure demo/embed modes are respected.

## Open questions
- Do we expose Messages as a top-level tab or rely solely on the Inbox widget + a Messages entry in More? (Default: include if full-thread mgmt is needed.)
- Do we need a “More” drawer on desktop for Integrations/Settings, or keep Integrations visible in sidebar?

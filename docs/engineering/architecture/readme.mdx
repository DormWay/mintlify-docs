# System Architecture

## Purpose
This section contains **system-level architectural decisions and designs** for DormWay platform. These documents answer "WHAT are we building?" and "WHY did we choose this approach?"

This is distinct from [Technical Architecture](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme), which focuses on implementation patterns and "HOW we build it."

## Structure
Architecture documents are organized by architectural domain (API design, real-time systems, dashboard, services, etc.) and include both current architecture and architectural decision records (ADRs).

## Key Architecture Documents

### Source of Truth (Canonical)
- [Source of Truth Index](/docs/engineering/architecture/source-of-truth-index) - Canonical, verifiable contracts for core systems

- [DormWay Platform – System Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/dormway-platform-system-architecture) - Platform architecture overview
- [Academic Workstation V2 Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/academic-workstation-v2-architecture) - Academic workspace architecture

### API & Services Architecture
- [API v2 Design - Resource-Oriented REST](/docs/engineering/architecture/api-v2-design-resource-oriented-rest) - API v2 design decisions (ADR-style)
- Ably Real-Time Updates Implementation Strategy - Real-time messaging architecture
- [Ably Relay Service Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/ably-relay-service-architecture) - Ably relay service design
- App Authentication Architecture - Authentication system architecture

### Dashboard & Frontend Architecture
- [Dashboard_Architecture_Refined](/docs/engineering/architecture/dashboardarchitecturerefined) - Dashboard architectural design

### Feature-Specific Architecture
- [BrainGains RAG Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/braingains-rag-architecture) - BrainGains RAG system architecture
- [Campus Connect Whitepaper](/docs/engineering/architecture/campus-connect-whitepaper) - Campus Connect system design
- [Course Context Matching - First Touch Pattern](/docs/engineering/architecture/course-context-matching-first-touch-pattern) - Course matching architecture
- [Demo System Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/demo-system-architecture) - Demo mode architecture

### Infrastructure & Cloud
- [canvas-sync-terraform-rebuild-notes](/docs/engineering/architecture/canvas-sync-terraform-rebuild-notes) - Canvas sync infrastructure

### Deprecated Architectures
These are kept for historical reference but are no longer active:
- DEPRECATED - Hybrid Push Notification Strategy - Old push notification approach
- DEPRECATED - WebSocket Real-Time Updates Implementation Strategy - Old WebSocket approach (replaced by Ably)

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### What are ADRs?
ADRs document significant architectural decisions, including:
- **Context**: Why the decision was needed
- **Decision**: What was decided
- **Consequences**: Trade-offs and implications
- **Alternatives**: Other options considered

### Major ADRs in this Section
- [API v2 Design - Resource-Oriented REST](/docs/engineering/architecture/api-v2-design-resource-oriented-rest) - REST over GraphQL decision
- Ably Real-Time Updates Implementation Strategy - Real-time system choice
- App Authentication Architecture - Auth strategy

## Architecture Categories

### 🏗️ System Design
High-level system architecture and component interactions.

### 🔌 Integration Architecture
How DormWay integrates with external services (Auth0, Canvas, Ably, etc.).

### 📊 Data Architecture
Data flow, storage patterns, and database design philosophy.

### 🚀 Deployment Architecture
How services are deployed and orchestrated.

### 🔐 Security Architecture
Authentication, authorization, and security patterns.

- [Technical Documentation](/docs/engineering/technical/readme) - Implementation documentation

## Distinction: System vs Technical Architecture

### System Architecture (This Section)
- **Focus**: Decisions and design
- **Audience**: Architects, tech leads, senior engineers
- **Questions**: WHAT are we building? WHY this approach?
- **Examples**: "Why REST over GraphQL?", "Why Ably for real-time?"

### Technical Architecture ([Technical Architecture](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme))
- **Focus**: Implementation patterns
- **Audience**: All engineers
- **Questions**: HOW do we implement this?
- **Examples**: "How do we handle errors?", "How do job processing flows work?"

## Architecture Principles

DormWay architecture follows these principles:
1. **Simplicity over Cleverness**: Choose simple, well-understood patterns
2. **Incremental Migration**: New systems coexist with old during transitions
3. **Leverage Standards**: Use HTTP caching, standard REST, proven patterns
4. **Document Decisions**: All major decisions have ADRs
5. **Evolution over Perfection**: Architecture evolves based on real needs

## Architecture Review Process

### When to Create Architecture Docs
- **Major system changes**: New services, significant refactors
- **Technology choices**: Adopting new frameworks, databases, services
- **Integration decisions**: Adding external service integrations
- **Performance changes**: Caching strategies, data flow optimizations

```

## Deprecated Architectures

### Handling Deprecation
When an architecture is superseded:
1. Prefix filename with "DEPRECATED -"
2. Update frontmatter: `status: deprecated`
3. Add "Replaced By" section linking to new architecture
4. Move to [Archive](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) after 6 months

### Why Keep Deprecated Docs?
- Institutional knowledge
- Migration context
- Understanding evolution
- Debugging legacy issues

## Maintenance
- **Owner**: Engineering Leadership
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly for active architectures, annual for deprecated
- **Archival Policy**: Move deprecated architectures to Archive after 6 months

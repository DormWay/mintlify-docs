# Deprecated Architectures Moved to Archive

**Date**: 2025-11-16

## Moved Files

The following deprecated architecture documents have been moved to [Archive/Architecture/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) to keep this section focused on current and active architectures:

1. **DEPRECATED - Hybrid Push Notification Strategy.md**
   - **Location**: Engineering/Archive/Architecture/DEPRECATED - Hybrid Push Notification Strategy
   - **Reason**: Superseded by current push notification implementation
   - **Archived**: 2025-11-16

2. **DEPRECATED - WebSocket Real-Time Updates Implementation Strategy.md**
   - **Location**: Engineering/Archive/Architecture/DEPRECATED - WebSocket Real-Time Updates Implementation Strategy
   - **Reason**: Replaced by Ably real-time messaging system
   - **See Current**: Ably Real-Time Updates Implementation Strategy
   - **Archived**: 2025-11-16

## Why Moved?

Deprecated architectures are preserved for historical reference and institutional knowledge, but moved to Archive to:
- Keep Architecture/ focused on current and active designs
- Reduce clutter when browsing architecture docs
- Maintain clear distinction between current and historical

## Finding Deprecated Architectures

All deprecated architectures are now in:
- [Archive/Architecture/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)

For the archival policy, see: [Archive Documentation](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)

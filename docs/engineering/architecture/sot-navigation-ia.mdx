# SoT - Navigation IA

## Scope
- Cross-platform navigation structure for LockedIn (web) and DormWay (iOS)
- Main navigation items, ordering, and naming conventions
- Settings placement and accessibility patterns
- Focus Panel / Inspector integration with navigation

## Non-goals
- Widget layout within surfaces (see [Home & Widgets](/docs/engineering/architecture/sot-home-widgets))
- Deep linking URL patterns (implementation detail)
- Visual design of navigation components

## Canonical Navigation Structure

### Main Navigation (5 Items)

| Order | Label | Web Route | iOS Tab | Description |
|-------|-------|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Today | `/dashboard/home-v2` | `.today` | Daily dashboard with widgets |
| 2 | Tasks | `/dashboard/tasks` | `.tasks` | Task management surface |
| 3 | Schedule | `/dashboard/schedule` | `.schedule` | Calendar and schedule view |
| 4 | Courses | `/dashboard/courses` | `.courses` | Course list and details |
| 5 | Library | `/dashboard/library` | `.library` | Documents, notes, files |

### Settings Placement

**Settings is NOT in the main navigation.**

| Platform | Location | Access Pattern |
|----------|----------|----------------|
| Web | Top-right header | User avatar dropdown or gear icon |
| iOS | Top-right nav bar | Gear icon button |

Route: `/dashboard/settings` (web)

## Current vs Target

### Web (LockedIn)
| Item | Current | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| Nav items | Today/Schedule/Tasks/Courses/Docs/Settings (6) | Today/Tasks/Schedule/Courses/Library (5) |
| Settings | In sidebar | Top-right corner |
| Docs | Named "Docs" | Renamed to "Library" |

### iOS (DormWay)
| Item | Current | Target |
|------|---------|--------|
| Tab items | Home/Schedule/Tasks/Term/Me (5) | Today/Tasks/Schedule/Courses/Library (5) |
| Settings | In "Me" tab | Top-right button (separate from tabs) |
| Term | Shows term courses | Renamed to "Courses" |
| Me | Profile + settings | Becomes "Library" |

## Invariants & Contracts

1. **5-item navigation maximum** - Main nav must have exactly 5 items across all platforms
2. **Consistent naming** - Same labels on web and iOS (Today, Tasks, Schedule, Courses, Library)
3. **Settings outside main nav** - Settings accessed via top-right, never as a main nav item
4. **Order consistency** - Same item order across platforms (Today first, Library last)
5. **Focus Panel integration** - All surfaces support inspector/detail panel via URL state

## Focus Panel Integration

The Focus Panel (Inspector) provides contextual details for entities without leaving the current surface.

### Supported Entity Types
| Entity | URL Pattern | Actions |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| task | `?inspector=task:uuid` | Complete, Edit, Delete |
| assignment | `?inspector=assignment:uuid` | Mark Complete, Open Source |
| course | `?inspector=course:uuid` | View Details, Navigate |
| course_list | `?inspector=course_list:uuid` | View All Courses |
| event | `?inspector=event:uuid` | View Details |

### Focus Panel Behavior
- Opens from any navigation surface
- ESC key to close
- URL state preserves deep links
- Max 3 pinned items
- Keyboard navigation supported

# Student OS Academics Workspace (Proposed)

Future-state workspace spec. Not current production truth.

See also: [Student OS Mobile North Star (Proposed)](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-mobile-north-star-proposed)

---

## 1. Purpose

The Academics workspace is where students actually do school:
- triage assignments
- see course context
- access materials
- plan study time
- write notes

It must feel coherent and predictable across courses and terms.

---

## 2. IA + layout

### 2.1 Workspace structure
Route: `/dashboard/academics` (recommended)

Subnav (left rail or top tabs):
1) **Tasks**
2) **Courses**
3) **Materials** (Library view filtered to academic)
4) **Insights** (standardized modules only)

### 2.2 Page layout (desktop)
- Left: subnav + filters (depends on subtab)
- Center: list/grid (tasks list, courses list, docs list)
- Right: **Focus Panel** (always the same interaction model)

### 2.3 Page layout (mobile)
- Subnav as segmented control
- List view full screen
- Focus Panel becomes bottom sheet

---

## 3. Tasks subtab (canonical work triage)

### 3.1 Primary jobs
- Know what is overdue / due soon
- Start work (note + materials)
- Plan time (schedule blocks)

### 3.2 Default sections
- Overdue
- Due Today
- Due This Week
- Upcoming

Each section is capped; "View all" uses Focus Panel list view.

### 3.3 Task card design (consistent everywhere)
Fields:
- Title
- Course chip (if applicable)
- Due date/time
- Estimate (if known)
- Status

Actions:
- Start
- Plan time
- Mark done

### 3.4 Task detail template (Focus Panel)
Tabs/sections:
- Summary (due, estimate, status)
- Linked course
- Linked materials (docs + notes)
- Actions (plan time, open in LMS, create note)

Rule: task truth lives here. Any insight is secondary.

---

## 4. Courses subtab (consistent course hub)

### 4.1 Primary jobs
- See all courses for term
- Open a course kit
- Access syllabus/materials/assignments

### 4.2 Course list cards
Fields:
- Code + title
- Instructor
- Meeting pattern
- LMS + syllabus status chips
- Upcoming due count

Actions:
- Open course
- Quick links: syllabus, assignments, materials

### 4.3 Course detail template (Focus Panel)
This template must be identical for every course.

Sections:
1) Overview
2) Upcoming assignments (pull from canonical Tasks)
3) Schedule (next class blocks)
4) Materials (docs + notes filtered by course)
5) Syllabus (policies, grading)
6) Insights (standardized cards only, governed)

---

## 5. Materials subtab (Library filtered to Academics)

This is basically Library, but filtered to the current term and academic context.

Content:
- Recent docs/notes
- Course stacks
- Inbox (unassigned uploads)
- Filters: course, type, source

---

## 6. Insights subtab (optional, governed)

This subtab contains only standardized insight modules.

Examples:
- Peak workload weeks
- High-weight assignments
- Policy risks (late work, attendance)

Rules:
- Every insight includes source + timestamp.
- Insights never contradict tasks/due dates/schedule.

---

## 7. Cross-flow hooks (must exist)

From Tasks:
- "Plan time" creates schedule blocks.
- "Start" creates/opens an assignment note and suggests materials.

From Courses:
- "Open class notes" from next class block.
- "Open syllabus" and "Upload syllabus" CTAs.

From Schedule:
- "Open class notes" creates/opens the session note.
- "Show related assignments" filters tasks.

---

## 8. Empty states (critical)
- No tasks: "All caught up" + CTA add personal task.
- No courses: connect LMS / upload syllabus.
- No materials: upload or connect.

Empty states must always include a next step.

---

## 9. Acceptance criteria
- Students never have to decide between Academic and Courses as separate top-level destinations.
- Every course looks the same in structure; no freeform AI layouts.
- Tasks, course assignments, and insights never conflict.

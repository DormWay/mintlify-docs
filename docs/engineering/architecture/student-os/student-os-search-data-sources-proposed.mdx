# Student OS Search Data Sources (Proposed)

Future-state search contract. Not current production truth.

This doc maps entity types to existing data sources and highlights gaps.

## 1. Entity -> data source map (v1)

Tasks
- Primary list: `/v2/students/me/tasks` (merged persistent + syllabus tasks)
- Fallback: tasks within Home V2 batch (`/v2/widgets/batch`)

Assignments
- Primary: derive from `/v2/students/me/tasks` (assignment sources) or dashboard composite
- Fallback: Home V2 batch (`/v2/widgets/batch`) due items

Schedule events
- Primary: `/calendar/events` (mobile calendar API)
- Fallback: Home V2 batch schedule widget (`/v2/widgets/batch`)

Courses
- Primary list: `/api/student/courses`
- Search: `/api/student/courses/search?q=...`

Documents
- List: `/api/search/documents` (Ragie-backed)
- Text: `/api/search/documents/text`
- Summary: `/api/search/documents/summary`
- Sources: `/api/search/documents/sources`

Notes
- Current behavior: documents list is used for notes/Docs discovery
- Future: add a first-class notes list/search endpoint if notes become a distinct entity

HeadsUp
- Source: `/v2/widgets/batch` (headsup widget payload)

System health / freshness
- Source: `/v2/students/me/freshness` (if available in current branch)

## 2. Permissions and scoping

- All user-facing search results are scoped to the authenticated user.
- Course-scoped results may include user-scope partitions as fallback where allowed.
- Admin-only endpoints must not be used in user search surfaces.

---

## 3. Ranking rules (v1)

- Group results by entity type: Actions, Tasks, Schedule, Courses, Library.
- Rank within a group by relevance, then recency.
- If a command matches exactly, show it first.

---

## 4. Latency targets (v1)

- p50 < 150ms, p95 < 400ms for cached or indexed sources.
- If any source exceeds the budget, return partial results with a non-blocking banner.

---

## 5. Gaps to resolve

- Dedicated detail endpoints are not consistently available; current inspectors often render from list payloads.
- Notes are not yet a distinct search entity; currently surfaced via documents list.
- Schedule search requires either a calendar list endpoint or schedule widget data in scope.

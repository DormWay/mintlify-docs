# Student OS UX Spec (Proposed)

This document defines a **future-state direction** for DormWay. It is not current production truth.

---

## 0. Summary

DormWay should feel like a **student operating system** with a predictable hierarchy:

- **Home (Dashboard)** = "Right Now" (glance + act)
- **Workspaces** = deeper "Manage / Plan / Study"
- **Focus Panel (Universal Inspector)** = the default "details" surface across the app
- **Global Command/Search (Cmd+K)** = the fastest way to jump + act anywhere
- **HeadsUp** = rare, trustworthy interrupts (no junk drawer)
- **Library** = one coherent system for docs + notes (not fragmented destinations)

This spec is intentionally **opinionated**: it chooses consistency and trust over maximal surface area.

---

## 1. Product Goals

### 1.1 North Star
Make it possible for a student to:
1) know what matters next **in under 10 seconds**, and
2) take a meaningful next step **in under 2 interactions**,
with **no guessing** about what is fresh, what is real, or where something lives.

### 1.2 What "best" means (student reality)
- **Glance first** (between classes, walking, stressed).
- **One obvious next action** per surface.
- **Strong defaults**; customization is optional power-user territory.
- **Trust > novelty**. "AI" is helpful only when it is grounded and consistent.

---

## 2. Non-negotiable UX contracts (system invariants)

### 2.1 Progressive disclosure by level
**Level 0 (Dashboard):** scan + quick action; avoid full navigation unless explicitly chosen.
**Level 1 (Academic Core):** list -> Focus Panel (details) -> optional full view.
**Level 2 (Life Logistics):** contextual panels/cards, deeper workflows on pages.
**Level 3 (Admin/System):** dedicated pages; HeadsUp only for "action required" or "sync broken".

### 2.2 Universal Focus Panel (Inspector) is the default details surface
- Clicking a thing (task/event/course/doc/headsup card) opens details in **one consistent panel**.
- The panel is **non-modal** by default; the dashboard remains interactive.
- "View all" opens a full list **inside the panel**, not a new page.
- Pinning is optional and bounded (max 3 pinned cards).

### 2.3 Widgets are not pages
Widgets exist to:
- show high-signal state
- support 1-tap actions
- open the Focus Panel for details

Widgets do **not** become alternate "mini pages" with their own hierarchy or deep management.

### 2.4 HeadsUp is not a feed
HeadsUp is a **small, governed interrupt surface**.
If we put "nice-to-know" content in HeadsUp, it becomes noise and students stop trusting it.

### 2.5 "No guessing" must be visible
If data is stale or missing:
- the UI must say so (freshness chips / system health card)
- and provide a next step (refresh / reconnect / view last updated)

---

## 3. Information Architecture (IA)

### 3.1 Recommended top-level navigation (web sidebar)
This is the cleanest long-term sidebar for daily student use:

1. **Home** (Dashboard / Right Now)
2. **Schedule** (Time authority / planning)
3. **Academics** (Tasks + Courses + Materials as one workspace)
4. **Library** (Docs + Notes)
5. **Profile menu** (Settings + Integrations + Support)

Note: This nav is proposed until the decision log is signed off.

### 3.2 Why this beats the current "Home / Schedule / Academic / Courses / Settings"
- "Academic" and "Courses" overlap and confuse ownership.
- Students do not think "tasks belong in one tab and courses in another" -- they think "academics = work + context."
- Settings is not a daily workflow; it should not compete visually with daily destinations.

### 3.3 The role of each destination

**Home**
- Glanceable dashboard
- Widgets only + optional onboarding widget
- No deep management

**Schedule**
- Canonical time view (day/week)
- Planning and block editing lives here
- Uses Focus Panel for event details

**Academics**
- Assignment/work triage, course context, and consistent "course kit" views
- Uses Focus Panel for task/course/doc details
- Subnav recommended: Tasks / Courses / Insights / Materials (Materials deep-links to Library)

**Library**
- Unified docs + notes system (locker + authoring)
- Search-first; course-aware
- Deep-linked everywhere (Schedule, Tasks, Courses)

---

## 4. Global Interaction Patterns

### 4.1 Global Command/Search (Cmd+K)
A single "jump + act" overlay that works everywhere.

Capabilities:
- Search tasks, assignments, schedule events, courses, docs, notes.
- Run commands: "Add task", "Plan study block", "Upload doc", "Start focus".
- Selecting a result opens the Focus Panel with primary actions.

### 4.2 Focus Panel + Pin Dock
- Default detail surface.
- One consistent layout across entity types.
- Optional pinned dock (max 3) for power users.

### 4.3 Deep links
Any widget or list item should have a deterministic deep link:
- Home widget item -> Focus Panel open on that entity
- Focus Panel -> "Open full view" -> appropriate page (Schedule / Academics / Library)

---

## 5. System-wide UI governance

### 5.1 AI / Intelligence
AI content is allowed only when:
- it is **grounded** in a source (syllabus, LMS, doc vault)
- it is **standardized** (same module shape everywhere)
- it never overrides canonical truth (tasks, due dates, schedule times)

### 5.2 Consistency rules
- No per-course custom layouts.
- No hard-coded values that pretend to be real (percentages, dates) without provenance.
- Use shared primitives + tokens (Card/Panel/Sheet) and semantic colors.

---

## 6. Trust, Freshness, and Data Quality UX

### 6.1 Freshness UI policy
- If freshness is below thresholds: show a **calm "Data may be out of date" chip**.
- If a critical source is broken (Canvas disconnected, sync failed): show a **HeadsUp "System health" card**.

### 6.2 Provenance
Every entity detail should show:
- Source (Canvas / Google Calendar / manual / syllabus / upload)
- Last updated timestamp
- Any "why shown" explanation (for HeadsUp and feed-like cards)

---

## 7. Accessibility (baseline)
- Keyboard support for command/search and Focus Panel.
- Predictable Escape behavior.
- Focus ring always visible on interactive controls.
- Color is never the only state indicator.

---

## 8. Metrics (success criteria)
- Time-to-first-action (Home): median < 10 seconds
- Completion rate: tasks completed / week up
- Staleness incidents: fewer "blank/incorrect" surfaces
- HeadsUp trust: low dismiss rate + high action rate

---

## 9. Phased rollout (high level)
Phase 1 (core trust + consistency):
- Ship Focus Panel + entity templates for Tasks/Schedule/Courses + HeadsUp cards.
- Add freshness chips + system health HeadsUp.
- Implement Global Command/Search for core entities.

Phase 2 (Academics + Library coherence):
- Convert Tasks + Courses into "Academics workspace" with subnav.
- Unify Notes + DocVault into Library with course tagging + search.

Phase 3 (power + polish):
- Pin Dock
- Full "course kit" view (Assignments + materials + notes)
- Standardized intelligence modules + workload forecasting

---

## 10. Open questions (to resolve fast)
- Confirm top-level naming: Academics vs Tasks.
- Confirm Library placement: top-level vs under Academics.
- What is the single keyboard shortcut for "Ask Ace" (if Ace exists separately) without colliding with Cmd+K?
- What are the initial supported entity types in global search v1?

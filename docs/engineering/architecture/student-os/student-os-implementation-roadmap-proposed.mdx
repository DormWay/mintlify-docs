# Student OS Implementation Roadmap (Proposed)

Future-state roadmap. Not current production truth.

---

## Goal
Turn the Student OS UX direction into an implementable roadmap with ticket-sized deliverables.

---

## Phase 0: Align contracts (1-2 days)
- Decide final sidebar structure: Home / Schedule / Academics / Library
- Decide where Settings lives (profile menu recommended)
- Confirm Cmd+K ownership (Global Command only)
- Decision log sign-off (Product lead + Engineering lead)

Deliverable:
- Signed-off decision log and canonical URL map.

---

## Phase 1: Focus Panel foundation (core consistency)

### 1.1 Panel infra
- Add Focus Panel container component (desktop + mobile sheet)
- URL state parsing (`?focus=type:id`)
- Close behavior (Esc, click outside, close button)
- Focus management + a11y baseline

### 1.2 Entity templates (v1)
- Task detail template
- Assignment detail template
- Schedule event detail template
- Course detail template (basic)
- HeadsUp card detail template (with why shown)

### 1.3 Hook into existing surfaces
- Home widgets open Focus Panel on click
- Schedule page blocks open Focus Panel
- Tasks page rows open Focus Panel
- Courses page rows open Focus Panel

---

## Phase 2: Freshness + no guessing
- Add provenance + last updated chips to templates
- Implement staleness UI:
  - Data may be out of date chip
  - HeadsUp system health card when critical
- Add Reconnect / Refresh CTAs

---

## Phase 3: Global Command/Search (Cmd+K)
- Single overlay component (no collisions)
- Search providers:
  - tasks
  - events
  - courses
  - docs/notes (BrainGains if available)
- Commands:
  - add task
  - add block
  - new note
  - upload doc
- Selecting result opens Focus Panel

---

## Phase 4: Academics workspace (de-duplicate Academic vs Courses)
- Create `/dashboard/academics` wrapper
- Add subtabs: Tasks / Courses / Materials / Insights
- Migrate existing tasks + courses pages into workspace
- Remove Academic Intelligence naming

---

## Phase 5: Library unification (DocVault + Notes)
- Consolidate routes into Library:
  - Overview / Files / Notes / Collections / Search
- Inbox for unassigned uploads
- Doc viewer + side notes experience
- Contextual entry points from tasks/schedule/courses

---

## Phase 6: Intelligence governance (ship only grounded modules)
- Implement standardized insight modules
- Remove freeform per-course AI pages
- Enforce provenance requirements

---

## Definition of Done (global)
- Every thing opens the same way (Focus Panel).
- Students can find tasks, courses, and materials without guessing where they live.
- Cmd+K always does the same thing.
- HeadsUp stays sparse and trustworthy.

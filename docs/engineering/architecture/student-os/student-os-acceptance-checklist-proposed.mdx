# Student OS Acceptance Checklist (Proposed)

Future-state acceptance criteria. Not current production truth.

---

## Global Command/Search (Cmd+K)
- Cmd+K opens exactly one overlay across the product.
- Cmd+K returns results for tasks, schedule, courses, and library.
- Selecting any result opens the Focus Panel (no full navigation).
- Ace shortcuts do not collide with Cmd+K.

## Focus Panel URL state
- Opening an entity writes `?focus=entity:id`.
- Legacy params (`?item=`, `?inspector=`) are read and mapped.
- Closing the panel clears `?focus=` without breaking page filters.

## HeadsUp governance
- HeadsUp shows only critical, actionable items.
- Every HeadsUp card includes a why-shown explanation.
- Dismiss and snooze persist across refresh.

## Freshness and provenance
- Every entity detail shows source + last updated.
- Stale data shows a visible "data may be out of date" chip.
- Critical staleness surfaces a system health card in HeadsUp.

## Navigation clarity
- Top-level nav items have non-overlapping ownership.
- Library/Notes are discoverable without hunting.
- Old routes redirect without breaking deep links.

## Focus Panel detail
- Task, assignment, course, and event details open from every list and widget.
- Detail view actions work (mark done, plan time, open source).
- If detail data is partial, the panel renders with a non-blocking warning.

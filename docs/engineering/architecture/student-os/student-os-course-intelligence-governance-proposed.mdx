# Student OS Course Intelligence Governance (Proposed)

Future-state governance. Not current production truth.

---

## 0. Why this exists

Current course intelligence pages can become:
- inconsistent per course
- visually chaotic
- full of hard-coded or untraceable values
- contradictory to canonical tasks and schedules

This spec defines what intelligence is allowed to be.

---

## 1. Core rule

AI insights are secondary to truth, and must be grounded.

Truth surfaces:
- Tasks / Assignments (due dates, status)
- Schedule (times)
- Course identity (title, instructor)
- Syllabus data (policies, weights) only when sourced

---

## 2. Insight card requirements (must-have fields)

Every insight card must include:

1) Title (short)
2) Claim (one sentence)
3) Action (what the student can do now)
4) Provenance
   - Source: syllabus / Canvas / uploaded doc / manual
   - Last updated timestamp
5) Confidence / coverage (optional but recommended)

If an insight cannot provide provenance, it should not ship.

---

## 3. Standardized module shapes (no freeform pages)

Allowed module types (v1):
- Workload forecast (this week / next week)
- High-weight assignments (with syllabus weight citation)
- Policy risks (late work, attendance) with quoted policy snippet
- Study suggestions (time blocks) derived from workload + schedule

Each module has a single shared component implementation.

---

## 4. Hard rules (what is NOT allowed)

- No per-course custom layouts or theming.
- No percent weights without syllabus source and timestamp.
- No invented dates, policies, professor preferences, or grade predictions.
- No duplication of assignments lists that can contradict Tasks.

---

## 5. Placement

Where insights are allowed:
- Course detail template (Focus Panel): Insights section (collapsed by default)
- Academics workspace: Insights subtab (optional)
- Home: HeadsUp only if urgent and actionable

Where insights are NOT allowed:
- A standalone top-level Academic Intelligence page that competes with Tasks/Courses

---

## 6. UX rules

- Insights default collapsed unless they are directly actionable.
- The first thing students see is always real objects (tasks, schedule, materials), not AI summaries.
- "Why am I seeing this?" link required.

---

## 7. QA checklist (ship/no-ship)
An insight module ships only if:
- It cites its sources
- It has an action
- It cannot contradict canonical truth
- It uses standardized components
- It degrades gracefully when data is missing (shows "not enough info")

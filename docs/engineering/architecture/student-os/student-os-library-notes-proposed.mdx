# Student OS Library & Notes (Proposed)

Future-state Library spec. Not current production truth.

See also: [Student OS Mobile North Star (Proposed)](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-mobile-north-star-proposed)

---

## 1. Problem this solves

Today, students experience notes and doc vault as vaguely connected systems:
- they do not know where to upload vs write
- materials are not reliably tied to courses
- there is not one obvious search-first place for "where is that PDF?"

The Library must establish a clear mental model:
- **Files are inputs** (Locker)
- **Notes are outputs** (student work)
- Both are organized by **course + term** and connected to tasks + schedule

---

## 2. Library mental model (student-first)

Students should only need to remember:

- "I need a file" -> Library -> Files
- "I need to write / study" -> Library -> Notes
- "I need stuff for a course" -> Course -> Materials (filtered Library view)

---

## 3. IA + placement

### 3.1 Sidebar placement
Recommended:
- Library is either:
  - a top-level tab, OR
  - a subtab under Academics (Materials)

Naming note:
- "Docs" is an acceptable label for Library as long as it owns both files and notes.

### 3.2 Library internal sections
1) **Overview** (recent + continue)
2) **Files** (Locker)
3) **Notes**
4) **Collections** (course/term stacks)
5) **Search** (global)

---

## 4. Overview (Library Home)

Purpose: continue where I left off + reduce hunting.

Components:
- Recent (docs + notes)
- Continue studying (last opened doc + linked notes)
- Inbox (unassigned uploads)
- Course stacks (top 4)
- Quick actions: Upload, New Note, Scan

---

## 5. Files (Locker)

### 5.1 Purpose
Storage + ingestion. No authoring.

### 5.2 File cards
- Title
- Type (pdf/doc/slides)
- Course + term chips
- Source (upload, Canvas, scan)
- Last opened
- Linked notes count

### 5.3 Upload flow (drag/drop)
1) Upload
2) Auto-suggest course (if possible) + file type
3) Confirm tags
4) File lands in correct course collection (or Inbox if unassigned)

### 5.4 Inbox
Unassigned files are not allowed to silently float forever.
Inbox requires resolution:
- assign course/term
- or mark General

---

## 6. Notes

### 6.1 Purpose
Creation + studying.

### 6.2 Note types (v1)
- Class notes (session-based)
- Reading notes (doc-based)
- Assignment note (task-based)
- Exam study note
- General note

### 6.3 Note metadata (must exist)
- Course chip (optional but encouraged)
- Date / session reference (for class notes)
- Linked docs
- Linked tasks (optional)

### 6.4 Editor consistency
- One editor design for all notes.
- No per-course custom styling.
- Side panel for links (docs/tasks) rather than messy inline gimmicks.

---

## 7. Doc viewer + side notes (core study experience)

When a student opens a document:
- Document viewer center
- Notes panel on the side (desktop) / bottom sheet (mobile)

Capabilities:
- Create note from doc (Reading note)
- Jump between doc and linked notes
- Save last scroll position (continue where I left off)

Optional later:
- lightweight annotation/highlights

---

## 8. Search (global)

### 8.1 Student expectation
Search must solve "where is that thing?" instantly.

### 8.2 Required
- Full-text search across:
  - doc titles + metadata
  - note titles + body
- Filters:
  - course
  - term
  - type (doc/note)
  - source
  - date

### 8.3 Integration
If BrainGains/RAG exists, use it for doc + note search (best experience).
Otherwise: ship a lightweight metadata + title search first.

---

## 9. Cross-product hooks (Library should be reachable everywhere)

From Schedule:
- "Open class notes" -> opens/creates session note in Library

From Tasks:
- "Start work" -> opens/creates assignment note + suggests relevant docs

From Courses:
- "Materials" -> opens Library filtered by course

From Home:
- Courses widget -> course -> materials section
- Tasks widget -> task -> linked materials
- Onboarding -> upload syllabus

---

## 10. Data model (conceptual)

Entities:
- Document
- Note
- Collection (course/term)
- Link (doc<->note, task<->note, course<->doc)
- Source (upload/LMS/scan)

Relationships:
- Document links many notes
- Note links many docs
- Course collection contains both

---

## 11. Edge cases to handle cleanly
- Duplicate uploads (same file): detect + suggest keep both / replace / merge
- Unknown course: route to Inbox
- Multiple courses in one doc: allow multi-course tagging
- Privacy: default private; sharing is explicit opt-in

---

## 12. Acceptance criteria
- One obvious place to find files + notes.
- Every doc/note can be tied to a course/term.
- Starting work from a task reliably takes a student to a note + materials.
- Search finds things fast and does not feel fake.

# Student OS Decision Log (2025-12-26)

Status: Proposed (needs sign-off)
Sign-off required: Product lead, Engineering lead

## 1) Top-level naming: Academics vs Tasks
Decision: **Academics as top-level**, with **Tasks as the default subtab**.

## 2) Library placement
Decision: **Library is top-level**, with Academics > Materials linking into Library filters.

## 3) Focus Panel URL state
Decision: **Canonical `?focus=`** with legacy `?item=` mapping for migration.

## 4) Cmd+K ownership
Decision: **Cmd+K is reserved for global Command/Search**. Ace must not collide.

## Next step
Confirm these decisions before ticketization and implementation.

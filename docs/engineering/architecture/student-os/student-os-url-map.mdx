# Student OS URL Map (v1)

Related: SoT - Command Search & Focus Panel

See also: [Student OS Mobile North Star (Proposed)](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-mobile-north-star-proposed)

Note: current beta uses `/dashboard/documents` as the Library surface (Docs label); `/dashboard/library` is a future-state route.

## Global rules
- Focus Panel state uses `?focus=`.
- Pin state uses optional `?pins=`.
- Legacy params are supported for reads, but URLs should be written in canonical form.

## Current vs target URL params

Current (production today):
- Home V2 inspector: `?inspector=` and `?split=`
- Academic/Tasks inspector: `?item=`

Target (future-state):
- Focus Panel: `?focus=entity:id`
- Optional pins: `?pins=entity:id,entity:id`

Migration rules:
- Read current params, translate to `?focus=` on state change.
- Preserve `?inspector=` and `?item=` for back-compat during transition.

### Focus Panel format
- `?focus=task:{id}`
- `?focus=assignment:{id}`
- `?focus=event:{id}`
- `?focus=course:{id}`
- `?focus=document:{id}`
- `?focus=note:{id}`
- `?focus=headsup_card:{id}`
- `?focus=system_health:{id}`

Optional pin format:
- `?pins=task:1,course:99`

## Top-level routes

Home
- `/dashboard/home-v2`

Schedule
- `/dashboard/schedule`

Academics (workspace)
- `/dashboard/academics?tab=tasks`
- tabs: `tasks | courses | materials | insights`

Library
- `/dashboard/library?tab=overview`
- tabs: `overview | files | notes | collections | search`

## Focus Panel deep links
- Task: `/dashboard/home-v2?focus=task:{id}`
- Assignment: `/dashboard/home-v2?focus=assignment:{id}`
- Event: `/dashboard/home-v2?focus=event:{id}`
- Course: `/dashboard/home-v2?focus=course:{id}`
- Document: `/dashboard/library?focus=document:{id}`
- Note: `/dashboard/library?focus=note:{id}`

## Legacy route redirects
- `/dashboard/academic` -> `/dashboard/academics?tab=tasks`
- `/dashboard/tasks` -> `/dashboard/academics?tab=tasks`
- `/dashboard/courses` -> `/dashboard/academics?tab=courses`
- `/dashboard/notes-hub` -> `/dashboard/library?tab=notes`
- `/dashboard/documents` -> `/dashboard/library?tab=files`
- `/dashboard/syllabus` -> `/dashboard/academics?tab=courses`

## Legacy query params
- `?item={id}` (Academic V2) -> map to `?focus=assignment:{id}` or `?focus=task:{id}`.

## Migration and back-compat plan
- Read legacy routes and params on load; write canonical URLs on state change.
- Keep redirects for at least 2 release cycles to preserve bookmarks and shared links.
- Log redirect and param-migration events for analytics and monitoring.
- If mapping fails, fall back to list view and show a non-blocking banner.

## Command/Search routing
- Command/Search is a global overlay and does not change route.
- Selecting a result opens Focus Panel via `?focus=`.

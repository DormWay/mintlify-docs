# Student OS Home V2 Widgets (Proposed)

Future-state Home widget behavior. Not current production truth.

---

## 1. Purpose

Home is the "Right Now" surface:
- instant clarity
- minimal cognitive load
- direct actions
- no deep management

---

## 2. Widget contract (canonical default set)

Home V2 is intentionally constrained:
- **Today**
- **Schedule**
- **Tasks**
- **Courses**
- **HeadsUp**

No additional widgets are considered canonical unless they are formally added to the widget contract.

---

## 3. Home layout (default)

### 3.1 Default hierarchy
Row 1 (highest priority):
- Today (wide)
- HeadsUp (compact)
- Tasks (compact)

Row 2:
- Schedule (tall)
- Courses (tall)

Row 3+:
- user personalization (still limited to contract widget types)

### 3.2 Edit mode rules
- Edit mode is explicit (no accidental drag).
- "Add widget" only offers contract widget types.
- Layout persistence must be stable and resilient across breakpoints.

---

## 4. Universal interaction model

### 4.1 Click behavior
- Clicking an entity within a widget opens the **Focus Panel** on that entity.
- Widgets do not open heavy modals for details.

### 4.2 "View all"
- "View all" opens a full list inside the Focus Panel (not a new page).
- The Focus Panel list view includes an "Open full view" link to the dedicated page (Schedule / Academics / Library).

---

## 5. Widget specs

### 5.1 Today widget
**Primary job:** context anchor + next decision.

Content:
- Date + time
- Context cues (weather, campus, "in class" vs "free time")
- Next block preview (event/task/assignment)

Interactions:
- Click next block -> Focus Panel (Schedule event detail)
- "Add buffer" quick action
- "Start focus" (if available)
- Weather detail opens Focus Panel (or lightweight sheet on mobile)

Empty states:
- No schedule: "Free time" + CTA "Add a block"
- No weather: "Set campus location" + CTA

### 5.2 Schedule widget
**Primary job:** show today's timeline + next free time.

Content:
- now-line
- next 3-5 blocks (cap)
- small "free time" highlights

Interactions:
- Click block -> Focus Panel (event detail)
- "Add block" quick action
- "View all" -> Focus Panel list (with "Open Schedule page" link)

Empty state:
- "No classes today" + CTA "Plan study block"

### 5.3 Tasks widget
**Primary job:** due-date triage.

Content:
- Overdue (if any)
- Due today
- Due soon (cap 3-5)

Interactions:
- Click task -> Focus Panel (task/assignment detail)
- Inline actions:
  - Mark done
  - Plan time (creates schedule block)
  - Start (opens note/focus)

Empty states:
- "All caught up" + CTA "Add task"

### 5.4 Courses widget
**Primary job:** course identity + quick access.

Content:
- Course cards (cap)
- Status chips (syllabus connected? LMS connected?)

Interactions:
- Click course -> Focus Panel (course detail template)
- Quick links: syllabus / assignments / materials

Empty state:
- "No courses connected" + CTA "Connect Canvas" or "Upload syllabus"

### 5.5 HeadsUp widget
**Primary job:** critical interrupts only.

Governance (examples of allowed card types in v1):
- Overdue assignment/task
- Due today within short window
- Schedule conflict imminent
- Canvas disconnected / sync failed
- Data stale beyond thresholds (system health)

Rules:
- Keep it sparse (cap 2-5 based on widget size).
- Every card must have:
  - "why shown"
  - primary action
  - dismiss/snooze (when relevant)

Empty state:
- "All Clear" + optional link "Open suggestions" (does NOT turn HeadsUp into a feed)

---

## 6. Data + reliability rules

### 6.1 Batch-first fetch
All Home widgets should prefer a single batch request.
Rendering must never hard-fail to blank.

### 6.2 Staleness UX
- If schedule/tasks/courses are stale: show "Data may be out of date" chip + CTA.
- If staleness crosses critical thresholds: show a HeadsUp "System health" card.

### 6.3 Offline
- Render cached data with "Last updated" timestamp.
- Do not collapse layout when data is missing.

---

## 7. Accessibility
- Widgets must be keyboard-navigable.
- Focus Panel opening maintains logical focus behavior.
- Screen reader labels for each card/action.

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria
- A student can open Home and know "what matters next" without scrolling.
- Clicking any item opens the Focus Panel with actions.
- HeadsUp does not contain feed-like content.
- Empty states always have a next step.

# Student OS Mobile North Star (iOS, iPadOS, macOS)

Future-state vision. Not current production truth.

## 0. Summary
The perfect DormWay app is a student operating system on every Apple screen: iPhone for fast, reliable actions on the go, iPad for planning and study work, and Mac for deep work, search, and orchestration. The experience is consistent across devices: the same language, the same places for the same objects, and one universal way to open details.

## 1. Scope
This document defines the ideal end-state for:
- iOS (iPhone)
- iPadOS
- macOS

It aligns with the Student OS specs:
- [Student OS UX Spec (Proposed)](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-ux-spec-proposed)
- Student OS Navigation IA (Proposed)
- [Student OS Focus Panel & Command (Proposed)](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-focus-panel-command-proposed)
- [Student OS URL Map](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-url-map)
- [Student OS Course Intelligence Governance (Proposed)](/docs/engineering/architecture/student-os/student-os-course-intelligence-governance-proposed)
- SoT - Command Search & Focus Panel

## 2. North Star Experience (Shared)
Every device delivers the same core promise:
- Know what matters next in under 10 seconds.
- Take a meaningful next step in under 2 interactions.
- Never guess where something lives (one consistent hierarchy).
- Trust what you see (provenance, freshness, and truth-first data).
- Move between devices without losing context.

## 3. Universal Information Architecture
All platforms share the same conceptual map:
- Home: Right Now (glance + act)
- Schedule: time authority (planning and edits)
- Academics: tasks + courses + materials + insights (one workspace)
- Library: docs + notes + search (one coherent system)
- Me/Settings: profile, preferences, integrations

Universal details surface:
- Focus Panel opens every entity type (task, event, course, doc, note).
- Focus Panel is a bottom sheet on iOS, a side panel on iPadOS/macOS.

Universal search:
- Cmd+K on macOS and iPad with keyboard.
- Search icon or Ace entry on iOS.
- Search results always open Focus Panel first.

## 4. Core Student Moments (Shared)
These moments must be fast, obvious, and reliable:
- Morning glance: what is today, what is due, what is next.
- Between classes: next location, upcoming tasks, quick reschedule.
- Assignment triage: sort by urgency, act in one tap.
- Study session: find materials, open notes, plan focus blocks.
- Capture: add a task, add a schedule block, upload a doc.

## 5. Platform North Stars

### 5.1 iOS (iPhone) North Star
Primary use: on-the-go, time-limited actions.
- Home is compact, capped, and action-first.
- Bottom nav is predictable and one-hand friendly.
- Focus Panel is a fast, swipeable sheet.
- Capture is always reachable within one tap.
- Offline-safe: actions queue and sync; staleness is explicit.
- Notifications are trustworthy and actionable (no noise).

### 5.2 iPadOS North Star
Primary use: planning and study work.
- Multi-column layout: sidebar, main content, Focus Panel.
- Split View and Stage Manager supported.
- Keyboard first-class (Cmd+K, arrows, shortcuts).
- Drag and drop between Academics and Library.
- Materials and notes feel like a workspace, not a list.

### 5.3 macOS North Star
Primary use: command center and deep work.
- Sidebar-driven navigation with persistent Focus Panel.
- Cmd+K is the fastest way to jump and act.
- Multiwindow workflows for Schedule, Academics, Library.
- Full keyboard control for triage and planning.
- Fast search over docs, notes, and tasks.

## 6. Design and Interaction Invariants
These rules must hold across all Apple platforms:
- Widgets are not pages (they open Focus Panel).
- HeadsUp is an interrupt surface, not a feed.
- Provenance and last-updated are always visible for insights.
- No AI claims without sources; insights never contradict truth.
- "View all" stays inside the Focus Panel, not a new page.

## 7. Data Trust and Freshness
The perfect app is honest about data:
- Every entity has source + last updated.
- Staleness is visible and actionable.
- System health issues surface as HeadsUp cards, not buried.
- If data is missing, the UI says so and shows the next step.

## 8. Non-goals
- No per-course custom layouts or theming.
- No separate "intelligence" pages that duplicate Tasks or Schedule.
- No hidden alternate navigation systems.

## 9. Success Measures (North Star)
- Median time-to-first-action: under 10 seconds.
- Most common actions require 2 interactions or fewer.
- Students can explain each top-level destination in one sentence.
- Trust metrics: low dismiss rate on HeadsUp, high action rate.

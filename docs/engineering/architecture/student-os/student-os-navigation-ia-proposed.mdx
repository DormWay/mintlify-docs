# Student OS Navigation IA (Proposed)

Future-state navigation contract. Not current production truth.

---

## 1. Goal

Make navigation obvious, minimal, and consistent with the DormWay student OS hierarchy.

Students should not have to ask:
- "Is this in Academic or Courses?"
- "Is this a page or a widget?"
- "Where are my notes vs my files vs my syllabus?"

---

## 2. Definitions

**Widget (Home):** glanceable, capped surface that opens details in the Focus Panel.
**Page (Workspace):** deep list/management surface with filtering, editing, and multi-step flows.
**Focus Panel:** universal detail surface (Inspector) used everywhere.
**Global Command/Search:** universal jump/act overlay (Cmd+K).

---

## 3. Recommended top-level navigation (sidebar)

### 3.1 The best long-term sidebar

1. **Home** — `/dashboard/home-v2`
2. **Schedule** — `/dashboard/schedule`
3. **Academics** — `/dashboard/academics`
   - default subtab: Tasks
   - subtabs: Tasks / Courses / Materials / Insights
4. **Library** — `/dashboard/library`
5. **Profile menu (avatar)**
   - Settings — `/dashboard/settings` (or `/settings`)
   - Integrations — `/dashboard/integrations`
   - Support / Feedback / Legal

Note: This nav is proposed until the decision log is signed off.

### 3.2 If you must keep the current route set (incremental path)
- Keep existing pages:
  - `/dashboard/tasks`
  - `/dashboard/courses`
  - `/dashboard/notes-hub`
  - `/dashboard/documents`
- But present them under a single "Academics" nav item via subnav or grouped nav.
- Deprecate "Academic Intelligence" naming inside Tasks; it becomes "Tasks".

---

## 4. Navigation rules (must hold)

### 4.1 Home is not a dumping ground
Home can show:
- Today, Schedule, Tasks, Courses, HeadsUp widgets
- an onboarding widget

Home cannot become:
- a full tasks manager
- a full course manager
- a full docs browser

### 4.2 Pages own truth
- **Schedule page** is the time authority (editing, planning).
- **Academics workspace** owns assignments + course context.
- **Library** owns files + notes.

### 4.3 The Focus Panel is the default detail surface
- From any page or widget, clicking an item opens the Focus Panel with:
  - a summary
  - primary action
  - details

Pages should not spawn random new detail pages.

---

## 5. Global overlays

### 5.1 Global Command/Search
- Entry points:
  - Keyboard: `Cmd+K` (Mac), `Ctrl+K` (Win)
  - UI: top bar search field (optional) or a "Search" icon
- Output:
  - opens Focus Panel on selection
  - can execute commands (Add task, Plan time, Upload doc)

### 5.2 Focus Panel + Pin Dock
- Focus Panel is always available on desktop; on mobile it becomes a bottom sheet.
- Pin Dock is optional and bounded (max 3).

---

## 6. Settings placement
Settings should be:
- in the profile/avatar menu
- or pinned to a bottom utility area separated from the main nav

Rationale: Settings is not a daily student workflow.

---

## 7. Sidebar ordering (why this order works)
- **Home** first: daily entry + quick scan.
- **Schedule** second: time planning is the 2nd most-used workflow.
- **Academics** third: work triage, course context, assignments.
- **Library** fourth: materials/notes are important but not always first click.
- **Settings** hidden: rarely needed.

---

## 8. Acceptance criteria (dev-ready)
- A new user can explain in one sentence what each nav item does.
- Clicking any item in a list or widget opens the Focus Panel, not a new detail page.
- There is exactly one Cmd+K behavior across the product.
- Academic and Courses no longer overlap as separate top-level tabs.

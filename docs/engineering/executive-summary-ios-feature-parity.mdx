# Executive Summary: iOS Feature Parity Project
**Date:** 2025-11-09
**Prepared For:** Executive Leadership, Product, Engineering
**Status:** 5-Phase Analysis Complete, Ready for Development

---

## TL;DR - The Ask

**Request:** Approve 4-day engineering sprint to achieve iOS/Web feature parity

**Investment:** 34 hours (1 iOS engineer × 4 days)

**Impact:** Close 3 critical gaps preventing iOS from being a complete academic product

**Timeline:** 7 weeks from development start to full public rollout

**Risk:** Low (all backend APIs ready, proven architecture patterns)

**ROI:** High (feature parity = competitive positioning, user retention)

---

## 1. What We Found

### Current State: iOS is 80% Complete ✅

**Good News:**
- ✅ Dashboard system works (same BFF as web)
- ✅ AI assistant (BrainGains) fully integrated
- ✅ Timeline/DayPlan widget exists (may be hidden)
- ✅ ICS calendar sync works
- ✅ iOS has 2 unique innovations (OCR schedule import, claim codes)

**The Problem:**
iOS is missing **3 critical features** that web has, making it incomplete for students:

| Missing Feature | Student Impact | Business Impact |
|----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **1. Canvas Grades** | Can't see grades on iPhone | Students check Canvas website instead → App abandonment |
| **2. Assignment Tracking** | No Start/Complete/Dismiss | Missing key workflow → Lower engagement |
| **3. Note Sync** | Notes don't sync to other devices | Data silos → Frustration, churn |

**Bottom Line:** iOS feels incomplete compared to web. Students notice.

---

## 2. What Needs to Be Done

### Priority 0 (Ship Blockers) - 34 Hours Total

#### Feature 1: Canvas Assignments & Grades (16 hours)
**What:** Let students connect Canvas with Personal Access Token, view all assignments with grades

**User Journey:**
1. Student connects Canvas (one-time setup)
2. Opens "Gradebook" tab
3. Sees all assignments with grades (A, B, C, color-coded)
4. Missing/late assignments highlighted in red
5. Tap assignment → See details, due date, submission status

**Technical Scope:**
- New service: `CanvasService.swift` (6 API methods)
- New UI: Canvas connection flow + Gradebook view
- Integration: Real-time sync via Ably

**Effort Breakdown:**
- Day 1: Service layer (6h)
- Day 2: UI layer (8h)
- Integration: Ably updates (2h)

---

#### Feature 2: Assignment Completion Tracking (8 hours)
**What:** Let students mark assignments as Started/Complete/Dismissed

**User Journey:**
1. Student sees assignment in gradebook
2. Taps "Start" → Creates 60-min focus session
3. Notification after 60 minutes
4. Taps "Complete" → Marked done, syncs across devices
5. Or taps "Dismiss" → Removes from suggestions

**Why It Matters:**
- Habit formation (students build completion routine)
- Cross-device sync (complete on phone, reflects on web)
- Analytics (track study patterns)

**Technical Scope:**
- New service: `AssignmentCompletionService.swift`
- Update existing UI: Add action buttons to assignment cards
- Integration: Focus timer, Ably sync

**Effort Breakdown:**
- Day 3: Service + UI (7h)
- Integration: Focus timer (1h)

---

#### Feature 3: Notes Sync (10 hours)
**What:** Sync notes across devices with conflict resolution

**User Journey:**
1. Student creates note on iPhone (class notes)
2. Note auto-syncs to server
3. Opens iPad → Note appears automatically
4. Edits on iPad → Syncs back
5. If edited offline on both devices → Conflict resolution UI

**Why It Matters:**
- Students want notes everywhere (phone → tablet → laptop)
- Current state: Notes siloed to one device (huge pain point)
- Competitive: Most student apps have note sync

**Technical Scope:**
- New service: `NotesSyncService.swift` (SHA-256 conflict detection)
- New UI: Notes list, editor, conflict resolution
- Integration: Auto-sync on background, manual sync button

**Effort Breakdown:**
- Day 4: Service layer (4h)
- Day 5: UI layer (5h)
- Day 6: Testing + polish (1h)

## 6. Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Factors ✅

| Risk Area | Why It's Low Risk |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Technical** | All backend APIs already deployed and tested on web |
| **Architecture** | iOS follows proven DI patterns, easy to extend |
| **Infrastructure** | No new servers needed, existing capacity sufficient |
| **Data** | Database tables already exist, no migrations required |

### Medium Risk Factors ⚠️

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Canvas API rate limits** | Aggressive caching, exponential backoff, batch requests |
| **Note sync conflicts** | Clear conflict resolution UI, server-wins default |
| **Canvas PAT confusion** | Detailed help screen with video tutorial |
| **Grade mismatch with Canvas** | "Last synced" timestamp, manual refresh button |

### No High Risks Identified

**Safety Net:** Phased rollout means we can catch issues at 25% before 100% rollout

---

## 7. Business Impact

### Student Value Proposition

**Before (Current iOS):**
- ✅ See schedule
- ✅ Chat with AI assistant
- ❌ Can't see grades (must use Canvas website)
- ❌ Can't track assignment completion
- ❌ Notes don't sync

**After (With Feature Parity):**
- ✅ See schedule
- ✅ Chat with AI assistant
- ✅ **See all grades on iPhone** ⭐
- ✅ **Track assignment completion across devices** ⭐
- ✅ **Notes sync everywhere** ⭐

**Result:** iOS becomes a **complete** academic companion, not just a schedule viewer

---

### Competitive Positioning

**Current State:**
- iOS feels incomplete vs. web
- Students prefer web for grades/assignments
- "When will iOS have grades?" is top feature request

**With Feature Parity:**
- iOS = Web in functionality
- Better than competitors (most don't have Canvas grades)
- Unique features: OCR schedule import, AI assistant, timeline intelligence

**Market Impact:**
- Retention improvement (students stay on iOS app)
- App Store reviews improve (feature completeness)
- Marketing angle: "Only student app with Canvas grades + AI"

---

### Revenue Impact (If Applicable)

**Assumption:** Features remain free (table stakes for students)

**But unlocks:**
- Premium AI features (note summarization with BrainGains)
- Premium analytics (grade trends, study patterns)
- Premium notifications (proactive assignment reminders)

**Conservative Estimate:**
- 30% increase in D30 retention
- 20% increase in engagement (sessions per week)
- 15% increase in NPS (feature completeness)

---

## 8. Why Now?

### Strategic Timing

1. **Backend is ready** - All APIs deployed and tested
2. **Architecture is proven** - DI patterns work well in iOS
3. **Student demand** - #1 feature request from iOS users
4. **Competitive pressure** - Other apps adding Canvas integration
5. **Beta momentum** - Large waitlist ready to test

### Opportunity Cost of Waiting

**Each week we wait:**
- Students continue using Canvas website (not our app)
- App Store reviews mention missing features
- Competitors close feature gap
- Beta users lose interest

**"Perfect is the enemy of good"** - Ship P0 now, iterate later

---

## 9. Open Questions (Need Decisions)

### Product Decisions Required

**Q1: DayPlan Widget**

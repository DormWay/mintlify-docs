# Campus Onboarding API

This is the canonical flow for selecting a campus during iOS onboarding and seeding backend context.

## TL;DR
- Use typeahead to get the campus UUID.
- Call campus metadata with the UUID to seed the context and return configuration.
- A friendly alias exists for slugs.

## Endpoints

1) Typeahead (public)
- `GET /api/mobile/campus/typeahead?q=<search>&limit=8`
- Returns: `{ results: [{ id, name, location, enrollment }], count, hasMore }`
- Behavior: Prioritizes exact and alias matches (e.g., MIT, UGA) with larger schools first.

2) Campus metadata (comprehensive seed)
- `GET /api/campus/{uuid}/metadata`
- Seeds campus context (if missing) and returns academic calendar, institution, timezone, and services.

3) Optional slug alias
- `GET /api/campus/by-code/{code}/metadata` (e.g., `umich`)
- Server resolves slug → UUID then uses the same metadata flow.

## iOS Integration Snippet

1. Query typeahead, let the user pick a campus:
   - Save `result.id` as the canonical campus ID (UUID)
2. Call metadata with that UUID:
   - `GET /api/campus/{uuid}/metadata`
3. Proactively fetch housing for richer first impression:
   - `GET /api/campus/{uuid}/housing`

Notes:
- Always store and use the UUID going forward.
- The alias route is for UX convenience — it’s not a long-term identifier.
- On cold-start, backend may return placeholders while enrichment completes.

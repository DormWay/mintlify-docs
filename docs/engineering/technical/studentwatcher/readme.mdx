## Key Concepts

### Digital Twin Pattern
StudentWatcher is a long-running Temporal workflow that:
- Maintains a "digital twin" of each student's state
- Processes signals from iOS app
- Triggers data refreshes and notifications
- Orchestrates morning/evening briefings

### Workflow Lifecycle
- Created on user signup
- Runs continuously (years)
- Handles daily cycles (DayPlan generation at 05:00 local)
- Processes real-time signals

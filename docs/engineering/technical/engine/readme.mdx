## Key Concepts

### Workflow Types
- **StudentWatcher** - Digital twin for each student
- **CampusProcessor** - Campus-wide data aggregation
- **DayPlanGenerator** - Daily briefing generation (05:00 local)
- **SyllabusProcessor** - Document processing pipeline

### Signal Patterns
- Signals flow from iOS → API Router → Engine
- Engine publishes events to Ably for real-time updates
- Customer.io handles user-facing notifications

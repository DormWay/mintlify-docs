# Current Stack (Q4 2025)

This summarizes the canonical stack choices. Use alongside `Technical/Development Guides/DormWay Golden Paths.md`.

- **Orchestration:** Temporal (workflows + schedules). Do not add cron jobs; replace any cron guidance with worker schedules and health checks.
- **LLM Gateway:** Portkey prompt registry (`callPortkeyPrompt` in @dormway/core / Engine activities). Helicone is deprecated; keep aliases only for backward compatibility until fully removed.
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (legacy `auroraDb.ts` naming still present but points to Neon). Supabase and Aurora references are historical.
- **Web:** Next.js App Router (LockedIn, syllabus-webviewer). Follow App Router patterns in Golden Paths and keep Zuplo/Clerk middleware in sync.
- **Gateway/Auth:** Zuplo edge gateway + Clerk auth. Express routes remain in api-router but Zuplo OAS is the source of truth for public paths; update both when adding routes.
- **Safety/Evals/Harness:** Use `smart-run.sh` and obsidian-tools for agent work; keep secrets in Doppler and prefer `doppler run --` for commands.

When in doubt, mirror the examples in Golden Paths and tag legacy docs for archiving.

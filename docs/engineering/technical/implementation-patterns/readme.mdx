# Technical Architecture Patterns

## Purpose
This section contains **implementation architecture patterns** for DormWay platform. These documents answer "HOW do we implement this?" with concrete patterns, flows, and technical details.

This is distinct from [System Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/readme), which focuses on architectural decisions and "WHAT we're building" and "WHY."

## Structure
Technical architecture documents are organized by implementation domain (error handling, job processing, service integration, etc.) and provide detailed implementation guidance.

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Service Architecture
- Processing Engine Service Architecture - Engine service implementation architecture
- [Dashboard BFF Implementation](/docs/engineering/technical/implementation-patterns/dashboard-bff-implementation) - BFF (Backend-for-Frontend) implementation
- External Services Integration - External service integration patterns

### Data & Query Patterns
- [BrainGains Query API](/docs/engineering/technical/implementation-patterns/braingains-query-api) - BrainGains query API implementation
- [BrainGains Service Data Methods Reference](/docs/engineering/technical/implementation-patterns/braingains-service-data-methods-reference) - Service data access methods
- Dining Hall Data Ingestion - Dining hall data ingestion pipeline

### Processing & Orchestration
- Job Processing Flow - Job processing implementation flow
- Scheduling & Orchestration - Temporal workflow orchestration patterns
- Error Handling & Retries - Comprehensive error handling and retry patterns

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Error Handling & Retries - Error handling across all services
- Notification Preferences Architecture - Notification preferences system
- [Multi-Institution Architecture Upgrade](/docs/engineering/technical/implementation-patterns/multi-institution-architecture-upgrade) - Multi-tenancy implementation

## Pattern Categories

### 🔄 Processing Patterns
How we process jobs, workflows, and background tasks.

### 🛡️ Resilience Patterns
Error handling, retries, circuit breakers, fallbacks.

### 📡 Integration Patterns
Connecting to external services (Canvas, Auth0, etc.).

### 🗄️ Data Patterns
Data access, caching, and persistence strategies.

### ⚡ Performance Patterns
Optimization techniques and performance best practices.

## Distinction: Technical vs System Architecture

### Technical Architecture (This Section)
- **Focus**: Implementation patterns
- **Audience**: All engineers (backend, full-stack)
- **Questions**: HOW do we implement this?
- **Examples**: "How do we handle retries?", "What's the job processing flow?"

### System Architecture ([System Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/readme))
- **Focus**: Decisions and design
- **Audience**: Architects, tech leads
- **Questions**: WHAT are we building? WHY this approach?
- **Examples**: "Why Temporal?", "Why REST over GraphQL?"

## Common Implementation Patterns

### Error Handling Pattern
From Error Handling & Retries:
1. **Classify errors**: Retryable vs non-retryable
2. **Implement retry strategy**: Exponential backoff
3. **Add fallbacks**: Graceful degradation
4. **Log & alert**: Comprehensive observability

### Job Processing Pattern
From Job Processing Flow:
1. **Enqueue job**: Add to Temporal workflow
2. **Process with retries**: Handle transient failures
3. **Update state**: Track progress in database
4. **Emit events**: Publish to event bus (Ably)

### Service Integration Pattern
From External Services Integration:
1. **API client abstraction**: Consistent interface
2. **Circuit breaker**: Prevent cascade failures
3. **Caching layer**: Reduce external calls
4. **Error translation**: Convert external errors to internal types

## Implementation Guidelines

### When to Create Technical Architecture Docs
- **New implementation pattern**: Reusable across services
- **Complex flow**: Multi-step processes
- **Integration guide**: Connecting to external systems
- **Best practices**: Standardizing approaches

## Pattern Evolution

### Updating Patterns
When implementation patterns change:
1. Update the document with new approach
2. Document migration path in "Evolution" section
3. Keep old approach documented for reference
4. Update `last_updated` in frontmatter

### Deprecating Patterns
When a pattern is no longer recommended:
1. Mark as `status: deprecated` in frontmatter
2. Add deprecation notice at top
3. Link to replacement pattern
4. Keep for 6 months before archiving

## Migration Reference

### Migration Date Tag
Most documents have `migration_date: '2025-07-10'` tag, indicating when patterns were formalized during the Temporal migration.

## Maintenance
- **Owner**: Engineering Team
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16
- **Review Frequency**: Quarterly or when implementation changes
- **Update Policy**: All implementation changes should update relevant pattern docs

## Key Concepts

### Data Flow
```
Canvas API or ICS feed → Engine workflows → canvas_* tables + time_blocks → scheduleProcessor → student_time_blocks → Dashboard (composite and v2 widgets)
```

### Integration Points
- **Assignments** - Due dates, grades, submissions
- **Courses** - Enrollment, schedules
- **Calendar** - ICS feed integration

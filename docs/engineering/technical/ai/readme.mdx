# AI & ML Technical Documentation

## Purpose
This section contains technical documentation for AI, ML, and intelligent systems in DormWay platform, including context prediction, RAG systems, ML behavior learning, and crew implementations.

**Consolidation Date**: 2025-11-16 - This section consolidates previously fragmented AI/ML documentation from `Technical/AI/` and `Technical/ML & AI/`.

## Structure
AI/ML documentation is organized by system type:

```
Technical/AI/
├── Context/           # Context system and prediction
├── RAG/               # Retrieval-Augmented Generation
├── Migration/         # CrewAI migration documentation
├── Crews/             # Reserved for technical crew docs
└── Root files         # General AI/ML documentation
```

## Core AI/ML Systems

### Context System ([Context/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme))
DormWay's intelligent context prediction and management system.

**Key Documents**:
- [Context System](/docs/engineering/architecture/sot-context-system) - Context system overview
- [DormWay Context System- Architecture & Implementation](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/context/dormway-context-system-architecture-implementation) - Full architecture
- [Context Prediction Pipeline Deep Dive (Current)](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/context/context-prediction-pipeline-deep-dive-current) - Canonical current trace: iOS → service_data → StudentWatcher → downstream updates
- Context/Context Prediction Prompt - Updated - Context prediction prompts
- Context/Context Cards UI Design Specification - UI specifications
- Context/Dashboard Context Integration - Dashboard integration
- [Smart Context Evaluation System](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/context/smart-context-evaluation-system) - Evaluation system

**What it does**: Predicts and surfaces relevant academic context (courses, assignments, materials) based on student behavior, time, location, and patterns.

### RAG System ([RAG/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme))
Retrieval-Augmented Generation for AI-powered search and question answering.

**Key Documents**:
- RAG/RAG System Documentation - RAG architecture and implementation
- [Vectara Tools Implementation](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/rag/vectara-tools-implementation) - Vectara integration
- [Ragie Ingestion, Webhooks, and ACE Query Pipeline Deep Dive (Current)](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/rag/ragie-ingestion-webhooks-and-ace-query-pipeline-deep-dive-current) - Current Ragie + ACE implementation (api-router + StudentWatcher signals)

**What it does**: Enables semantic search across student materials, course content, and institutional knowledge using vector embeddings.

### CrewAI Migration ([Migration/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme))
Documentation for migrating to CrewAI framework for AI agent orchestration.

**Key Documents**:
- Migration/CrewAI Migration Implementation Plan - Migration roadmap
- Migration/CrewAI Knowledge and Memory Integration Plan - Knowledge system integration

**Status**: Historical - migration completed July 2025

### ML Behavior Learning
Machine learning systems for understanding and predicting student behavior patterns.

**Key Document**:
- [ML Behavior Learning Architecture](/docs/engineering/technical/ai/ml-behavior-learning-architecture) - ML architecture for behavioral prediction

**What it does**: Learns from student interactions to improve context prediction, notification timing, and personalized recommendations.

## Cross-Cutting AI/ML Documentation

### AI Model Performance
- AI Model Performance Analysis - Performance metrics and optimization

### Documentation & Guides
- AI-Powered Documentation Guide - Using AI for documentation generation

## Related Sections

### AI Crews Specifications
- [AI Crews](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) - Individual crew specifications (Semester Analysis Crew, Student Daily Intelligence Crew, etc.)

**Distinction**: AI Crews/ contains **what each crew does** (specifications), while Technical/AI/ contains **how the systems work** (implementation).

### AI Features
- [Features/AI & RAG](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) - ACE AI Assistant feature documentation
- [BrainGains](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) - AI-powered learning assistance feature

### System Architecture
- [BrainGains RAG Architecture](/docs/engineering/architecture/braingains-rag-architecture) - BrainGains RAG system architecture (high-level)

## AI/ML Technology Stack

### LLM Providers
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4 for general intelligence
- **Anthropic**: Claude for analysis and reasoning
- **Custom Models**: Fine-tuned models for specific tasks

### Vector Stores
- **Vectara**: Managed vector search service
- **PostgreSQL pgvector**: Local vector storage

### Frameworks
- **CrewAI**: Agent orchestration framework (migrated July 2025)
- **LangChain**: (deprecated, replaced by CrewAI)
- **Temporal**: Workflow orchestration for ML pipelines

### ML Infrastructure
- **Python Services**: dormway-crews service (port 8000)
- **FastAPI**: API framework for ML services
- **Temporal Workers**: Background processing for ML jobs

## AI/ML Patterns

### Context Prediction Pattern
1. Gather signals (time, location, calendar, behavior)
2. Score contexts using ML model
3. Rank and filter predictions
4. Surface top N contexts in UI

### RAG Pattern
1. Embed query using text-embedding model
2. Search vector store for relevant documents
3. Retrieve top K documents
4. Augment LLM prompt with retrieved context
5. Generate response

### Crew Orchestration Pattern
1. Define crew with specialized agents
2. Assign tasks with dependencies
3. Execute in Temporal workflow
4. Aggregate results
5. Update database

## Development Guidelines

### When Working on AI/ML Features
1. **Context**: Check [Context System](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme) first
2. **RAG**: See [RAG System](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)
3. **Crews**: Reference [AI Crews](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)
4. **New ML Models**: Document performance in AI Model Performance Analysis

### Testing AI/ML Systems
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end flows
- **Performance Tests**: Track latency and accuracy
- **A/B Tests**: Compare model versions in production

### Monitoring AI/ML
- Track prediction accuracy
- Monitor LLM costs and latency
- Log model versions and prompts
- Alert on degraded performance

## Consolidation Notes

### What Was Consolidated (2025-11-16)
- ✅ Merged `Technical/ML & AI/` into `Technical/AI/`
- ✅ Organized docs into Context/, RAG/, Migration/ subdirectories
- ✅ Moved CrewAI migration docs from Features/AI Crews/
- ✅ Moved semester planning docs to AI Crews/
- ✅ Removed empty `Features/AI Crews/` directory

### What Was NOT Consolidated
- **AI Crews/** - Kept separate (crew specifications)
- **Features/AI & RAG/** - Kept separate (ACE feature docs)

### Redirect Notes
If you're looking for:
- **Crew specifications** → [AI Crews](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)
- **ACE AI Assistant** → [Features/AI & RAG](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)
- **CrewAI migration** → [Migration/](/docs/engineering/ai-crews/readme)

## Maintenance
- **Owner**: AI/ML Team
- **Last Updated**: 2025-11-16
- **Review Frequency**: Bi-weekly for active systems, quarterly for historical docs
- **Update Policy**: All AI/ML system changes should update relevant documentation

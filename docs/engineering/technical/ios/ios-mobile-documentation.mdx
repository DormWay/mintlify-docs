# iOS Mobile Documentation

## Overview

DormWay's iOS application is built with modern SwiftUI architecture featuring LLM-powered context intelligence, comprehensive settings management, and real-time data synchronization through a unified dashboard system.

## Current vs Target vs Legacy

- Current (DormWayFresh): Home, Schedule, Tasks, Term, Me.
- Legacy naming in docs/widgets: home, campus, me.
- Target Student OS naming: Home, Schedule, Tasks, Term/Courses, Profile.

## Recent Major Achievements

### LLM Context Intelligence (June 19, 2025)
Revolutionary context detection system enhancing the existing state machine with ML predictions:
- **LLMContextService**: Orchestrates predictions with automatic state machine fallback
- **Weather Integration**: 12+ weather fields for context-aware predictions
- **Enhanced Responses**: Location analysis, temporal insights, environmental factors
- **100% Reliability**: Comprehensive fallback ensures context always available
- **Performance**: 5-minute cache, ~2s predictions, 80% cache hit rate

### Settings System Transformation (May 26, 2025)
Complete overhaul of the iOS Settings system to production-ready functionality:
- **Account Management**: Tap-to-edit profile with database persistence
- **Permissions Management**: All 5 permission types with real system integration  
- **Integration Services**: Real service implementations replacing placeholders
- **Professional UI**: Consistent status capsules and design system integration

### Widget System Implementation (July 2025)
AI-powered widget framework for dynamic dashboard content:
- **Widget Integration**: Complete iOS implementation guide
- **AI Selection**: Smart widget prioritization based on context
- **Extensible Architecture**: Plugin-based widget registry

## Technical Highlights

### LLM Context Intelligence Architecture
Advanced ML-powered context detection with guaranteed reliability:
```swift
// LLM Service with Automatic Fallback
LLMContextService.predictContext() → API Call → PortKey → Amazon Nova Lite
                                  ↓ (on failure)
                        State Machine Fallback → Time-based Rules
                                  ↓
                        ContextType (100% guaranteed)
```

### Settings Store Architecture
Modern store-based pattern with comprehensive functionality:
```swift
// Settings Store Pattern
SettingsStore → SettingsReducer → SettingsEffects → Real Services
    ↓
AccountState, PermissionsState, IntegrationsState, PreferencesState
    ↓
SwiftUI Views with proper state binding and effects
```

### Widget Integration Pattern
```swift
// Widget rendering pipeline
WidgetData → WidgetRegistry → WidgetView → SwiftUI Rendering
    ↓
AI Selection → Priority Sorting → Context Filtering
    ↓
Dynamic Dashboard Content
```

## Getting Started

For new developers, start with the iOS Architecture Overview to understand the app structure, then review [DormWayFresh Implementation](/docs/engineering/architecture/dormwayfresh-ios-architecture) for the modern architecture patterns. The [iOS Widget Integration Guide](/docs/engineering/technical/ios/ios-widget-integration-guide) guide covers the latest AI-powered features.

# Documentation Systems Index

## Overview

This section contains all documentation related to DormWay's documentation infrastructure, deployment guides, and system architecture.

## Current System

### Obsidian Documentation System
Our active documentation platform combining Obsidian's rich features with Claude Code's automation capabilities.

**Status**: 🟢 Active Implementation

**Key Features**:
- Zero API limitations
- Rich markdown with wikilinks
- Team collaboration via sync
- Automated documentation generation
- Natural language queries

## Deployment Documentation

### Digital Ocean Deployment Guide
**Status**: 📘 Ready for deployment

Complete step-by-step guide for deploying the Obsidian documentation system on Digital Ocean using Docker Compose.

**Highlights**:
- $16.40/month all-inclusive
- 4 Docker containers
- SSL, monitoring, backups included
- 30-45 minute setup

### Railway Deployment Analysis
**Status**: ❌ Not suitable

Analysis of Railway platform showing why it doesn't meet our multi-container requirements.

**Key Issues**:
- No docker-compose support
- Cannot share volumes between services
- Higher cost for less functionality

## Documentation Evolution

Our documentation system has evolved through several iterations:

1. **MkDocs** (Static) → Limited real-time updates
2. **Outline API** → Rate limiting issues
3. **Custom Middleware** → Too complex
4. **Obsidian + Claude Code** → Current solution ✅

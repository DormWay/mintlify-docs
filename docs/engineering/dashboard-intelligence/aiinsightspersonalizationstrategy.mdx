# AI Insights & Personalization Strategy

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: December 8, 2025
**Purpose**: Comprehensive analysis of data we collect, AI insights we can generate, and how to surface them without being "scary"

---

## Executive Summary

DormWay has access to an unprecedented amount of student data across multiple dimensions:
- **Per-Class**: Syllabus details, grading policies, attendance requirements, professor style
- **Per-Assignment**: Due dates, weights, estimated effort, submission status
- **Per-Student**: Behavioral patterns, energy curves, productivity hours, submission habits
- **Per-University**: LMS type (Canvas/Blackboard/etc.), academic calendar, campus events

This document outlines what insights we can generate and how to surface them in a **non-invasive, trust-building** way.

---

## Part 1: Data We Currently Store

### 1.1 Syllabus Extraction (Per-Class)

From `syllabus-claude-extractor.ts`, we extract:

| Category | Fields | AI Insight Potential |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| **Course Info** | courseCode, courseTitle, semester, department, year | Match student to institutional patterns |
| **Instructor** | name, email, phone, office, officeHours | Surface office hours before exams |
| **Meetings** | days, start_time, end_time, location | Calculate travel time, conflict detection |
| **Grading** | components, scale, special_policies | Weight-based priority scoring |
| **Assignments** | name, type, weight, points, due_date, estimated_hours, preparation_strategies | Workload forecasting |
| **Schedule** | week, date, topics, homework | Topic-based study recommendations |
| **Policies** | attendance, late_work, academic_integrity, make_up_exams, collaboration, ai_tools, extensions, accommodations | Risk alerting ("attendance graded!") |
| **Hidden Insights** | hidden_workload, professor_style, success_indicators | Personalized coaching |

**Professor Style Detection** (from syllabus tone):
- `approachability`: "formal" | "casual" | "supportive"
- `flexibility_level`: "strict" | "moderate" | "flexible"
- `teaching_approach`: "lecture-heavy" | "discussion-based" | "project-focused"
- `grading_tendencies`: "curves grades" | "strict rubrics" | "participation matters"
- `communication_style`: "email-preferred" | "office-hours-focused"

### 1.2 Canvas Integration (Real-Time Academic Data)

From Canvas sync, we store:

| Table | Data | AI Use |
|-------|------|--------|
| `canvas_assignments` | Due dates, points, descriptions | Real-time deadline tracking |
| `canvas_submissions` | Submission status, score, late, missing, excused | Submission pattern analysis |
| `canvas_courses` | Course metadata, enrollment status | Cross-reference with syllabus |
| `student_time_blocks` | Normalized events from all sources | Unified calendar view |

**Canvas Analytics API Data** (when available):
- `page_views` - Engagement metric
- `participations` - Discussion activity
- `tardiness_breakdown` - `{on_time: 8, late: 2, missing: 1}`
- `current_score` / `current_grade` - Real-time grade

### 1.3 DayPlan System (Per-Student Behavioral Model)

From StudentWatcher Digital Twin:

| Data Point | Source | Insight |
|------------|--------|---------|
| `energyCurve` | Predicted from patterns | "You're most productive 10am-2pm" |
| `stressPoints` | Workload + schedule analysis | "Wednesday looks intense" |
| `dayFlow.overallPace` | Event density | "Light day" vs "Hectic day" |
| `productivity_hours` | Historical behavior | Morning person vs night owl |
| `submission_patterns` | Canvas data | Procrastinator detection |
| `study_group_participation` | Social data | Isolation risk |

### 1.4 Campus & City Context

| Level | Data | Insight |
|-------|------|---------|
| **Campus** | Buildings, locations, events | "You have 12 minutes to get to BSB1060" |
| **City** | Weather, local events | "It's raining - leave 5 min early" |
| **University** | Academic calendar, LMS type | Semester milestones, system-specific features |

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.2 Per-Assignment Insights

**Smart Priority Scoring** (from DayPlan V2):

```typescript
interface AssignmentInsight {
  title: string;
  courseName: string;
  dueTime: string;

  // Weight-based priority
  gradeImpact: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  percentOfGrade: number;

  // Time-based urgency
  hoursUntilDue: number;
  estimatedHoursToComplete: number;
  canCompleteBefore: boolean;

  // AI recommendation
  suggestedStartTime: string;
  suggestedStudyBlocks: SuggestedBlock[];
  riskLevel: 'safe' | 'tight' | 'at-risk' | 'impossible';

  // Contextual insight
  insightReason: string;  // "This is 25% of your grade and due in 48 hours"
}
```

### 2.3 Per-Student Insights

**Academic Risk Detection** (from Canvas Full Plan):

| Risk Signal | Detection Method | Intervention |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Grade decline | 3+ assignments trending down | "Your ECON 301 grades are slipping" |
| Missing submissions | Canvas `missing: true` | "You have 2 missing assignments" |
| Late pattern | `tardiness_breakdown` analysis | "You've submitted late 3 times this month" |
| Workload crunch | 3+ assignments same week | "Heavy week ahead: 4 assignments due" |
| Isolation risk | No study group participation | "Consider joining COMM 230 study group" |

**Behavioral Insights**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🧠 YOUR PATTERNS                                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Peak Productivity: 10am - 2pm                               │

│ You perform best in morning slots.                          │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2.4 Per-University Insights

**LMS Detection from First Users**:

```typescript
// When a user connects to their university:
interface UniversityContext {
  lmsType: 'canvas' | 'blackboard' | 'moodle' | 'brightspace' | 'unknown';
  canvasInstanceUrl?: string;  // e.g., "umich.instructure.com"

  // Detected from connected users
  commonCoursePatterns: {
    typicalSemesterStart: string;
    typicalFinalsPeriod: string;
    commonGradingScale: GradeScale;
  };

  // Feature availability
  features: {
    canvasLiveEvents: boolean;
    syllabusUploadRequired: boolean;
    officeHoursBooking: boolean;
  };
}
```

**University-Specific Prompts**:

| Scenario | What We Detect | Proactive Prompt |
|----------|----------------|------------------|
| Canvas school | User email domain + Canvas OAuth | Auto-prompt Canvas connection |
| Blackboard school | User email domain, no Canvas | "Upload your syllabi to get started" |
| Registration period | Academic calendar + user enrollments | "Add your new courses" |
| Finals approaching | 2 weeks before detected finals | "Finals mode: let's plan your study schedule" |

---

## Part 3: Surfacing Insights Without Being Scary

### 3.1 The Trust Spectrum

```
SCARY ←─────────────────────────────────────────────→ HELPFUL

"We noticed you've been      "Your COMM 230 assignment
late to class 3 times"       is worth 25% of your grade"

"Your productivity drops     "Tuesday looks like a good
after 3pm based on your      day to work on this"
submission patterns"

"We detected you haven't     "Missing anything? Sync
opened Canvas in 4 days"     your Canvas for the latest"
```

### 3.2 Principle: Explain the Data, Not the Surveillance

**Bad (Scary)**:
> "Based on your location data, you have 12 minutes to reach your next class"

**Good (Helpful)**:
> "Your COMM 230 class in BSB1060 starts in 25 minutes. It's a 12-minute walk from the library."

**Principle**: Always explain **what** data informed the insight, not **how** we tracked it.

### 3.3 Friction Points to Consider

| Insight Type | Necessary Friction? | Implementation |
|--------------|---------------------|----------------|
| Attendance warnings | Yes - first time | Explain why we know attendance is graded (from syllabus) |
| Grade decline alerts | Yes - opt-in | "Want grade insights? Connect Canvas" |
| Study time suggestions | No - helpful default | Just show the suggestion |
| Professor style | Optional | Hidden until user asks "tell me about this professor" |
| Workload forecasting | No - helpful default | Show as part of weekly view |

### 3.4 Progressive Disclosure Model

**Level 1: Glanceable** (Always Visible)
- What's due today
- Next class time/location
- Urgent conflicts

**Level 2: Expandable** (Tap to Reveal)
- Why this is prioritized
- Grade weight / impact
- Suggested study blocks

**Level 3: On-Demand** (Ask Ace)
- "Tell me about this professor's style"
- "How am I doing in this class?"
- "What should I prioritize this week?"

### 3.5 UI Patterns for Non-Scary Insights

**Pattern 1: The Gentle Nudge**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ 📚 COMM 230 Assignment                 │
│ Due: Tomorrow 11:59pm                  │
│ ──────────────────────────────────────│
│ Worth 25% of your grade                │
│ ⏱️ ~3 hours to complete                │
│                                        │
│ ┌──────────────────────────────────┐  │
│ │ 💡 Suggested: Start today 2-5pm  │  │
│ └──────────────────────────────────┘  │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Pattern 2: The Contextual Explanation**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐

## Part 4: University-Specific Detection & Prompts

### 4.1 LMS Detection Strategy

**Step 1: Email Domain Analysis**
```typescript
// When user signs up with university email
async function detectUniversityLMS(email: string): Promise<LMSConfig | null> {
  const domain = email.split('@')[1];

  // Check campus_configs for known mappings
  const campus = await db.campus_configs.findFirst({
    where: { email_domains: { contains: domain } }
  });

  if (campus?.canvas_instance_url) {
    return {
      type: 'canvas',
      instanceUrl: campus.canvas_instance_url,
      features: ['live_events', 'oauth', 'calendar_sync']
    };
  }

  // Fall back to first-user detection
  return null;
}
```

**Step 2: First-User Discovery**
```typescript
// When first user from a university connects Canvas
async function recordLMSDiscovery(userId: string, oauthResponse: CanvasOAuth) {
  const user = await db.accounts.findUnique({ where: { id: userId } });
  const campus = await getCampusFromEmail(user.email);

  if (campus && !campus.canvas_instance_url) {
    // First Canvas user from this campus!
    await db.campus_configs.update({
      where: { id: campus.id },
      data: {
        canvas_instance_url: oauthResponse.instanceUrl,
        lms_detected_at: new Date(),
        lms_detected_by: userId  // Credit the pioneer
      }
    });

    logger.info('LMS discovery', {
      campus: campus.name,
      lmsType: 'canvas',
      detectedBy: userId
    });
  }
}
```

### 4.2 Smart Onboarding by LMS Type

| LMS Type | Detected How | Onboarding Flow |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Canvas** | OAuth + instance URL | "Connect Canvas" → Auto-sync courses, assignments, grades |
| **Blackboard** | Email domain lookup | "Upload your syllabi" → Manual entry assisted by AI |
| **Moodle** | User reports / email domain | "Export your calendar" → ICS import |
| **Unknown** | No detection | "Tell us about your courses" → Full manual setup |

### 4.3 Proactive Prompts by Context

**Prompt: Canvas Available**
```
┌────────────────────────────────────────┐

│ We'll extract:                         │
│ • Class schedule & locations           │
│ • Assignment due dates                 │
│ • Grading breakdown                    │
│ • Professor policies                   │
│                                        │
│ [I've sent my syllabi]                 │
│                                        │
│ or [Add courses manually]              │
└────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Part 5: The "Why" Behind Every Insight

### 5.1 Insight Attribution Framework

Every AI insight MUST explain its source:

```typescript
interface InsightWithAttribution {
  insight: string;

  // Attribution (shown on expand/hover)
  source: 'syllabus' | 'canvas' | 'calendar' | 'pattern' | 'campus';
  sourceDetail: string;  // "From your COMM 230 syllabus"

  // Confidence
  confidence: 'certain' | 'likely' | 'suggested';

  // User control
  canDismiss: boolean;
  canDisable: boolean;
}
```

### 5.2 Example Insight Attributions

| Insight | Source | Attribution Text |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| "Attendance matters" | Syllabus | "From your COMM 230 syllabus: 'Participation includes attendance'" |
| "Assignment worth 25%" | Syllabus | "COMM 230 grading breakdown shows this is 25% of your grade" |
| "You submitted late 3x" | Canvas | "Based on your Canvas submission history" |
| "Start Tuesday 2pm" | Pattern | "You typically complete similar assignments in 3 hours" |
| "12 min walk to class" | Campus | "Based on campus building locations" |

---

## Part 6: Implementation Recommendations

### 6.1 Dashboard Widget Enhancements

**ActionCTAWidget (Next Action)**:
- Add `insightReason` field explaining WHY this is the priority
- Show grade weight for assignments
- Surface attendance policies for classes

**TasksWidget**:
- Group by urgency + grade impact
- Show "late penalty" for overdue items
- Highlight missing Canvas submissions

**ScheduleWidget**:
- Add "attendance graded" indicator for classes
- Show professor office hours before exams

### 6.2 New Widget Ideas

**CourseHealthWidget**:
- Show grade trend per course
- Surface attendance warnings
- Highlight upcoming high-stakes assignments

**WorkloadForecastWidget**:
- Weekly view of assignment density
- "Heavy week" warnings
- Suggested study block reservations

### 6.3 Notification Strategy

| Notification Type | Frequency | Opt-Out |
|------------------|-----------|---------|
| Assignment due (24h) | Per assignment | Per-assignment snooze |
| Class starting (15m) | Per class | Disable per class |
| Grade posted | Immediate | Disable all grade notifications |
| Heavy week warning | Once/week | Disable workload alerts |
| Attendance reminder | First instance | Acknowledge and dismiss |

---

## Part 7: Privacy & Trust Principles

### 7.1 Core Principles

1. **Explain the data, not the surveillance**
   - Show what we know, not how we learned it

2. **Insights should help, not judge**
   - "Consider starting Tuesday" not "You always procrastinate"

3. **User controls everything**
   - Every insight type can be disabled
   - All data can be deleted

4. **Progressive trust-building**
   - Start with helpful, obvious insights
   - Unlock deeper insights as user engages

5. **Attribution is mandatory**
   - Every insight explains its source

### 7.2 What We DON'T Do

- Never show cross-student comparisons
- Never reveal professor ratings from other students
- Never share location data with other users
- Never push notifications about "missed" activities
- Never make users feel surveilled

---

## Next Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Update ActionCTAWidget with `insightReason` (from DASHBOARD_QUALITY_PLAN.md)
2. **Phase 2**: Add syllabus-derived insights to class events
3. **Phase 3**: Build Canvas-powered grade insights (opt-in)
4. **Phase 4**: Implement university-specific onboarding flows
5. **Phase 5**: Add workload forecasting widget

## Landing Page Implementation Roadmap

**Current State**: Existing page at dormway-lockedin/src/app/page.tsx

**Goal State**: Follows Landing Page Copy Specification exactly

### Phase 1: Critical Copy Changes (Week 1)

**Priority 1: Hero Section**
- [ ] Add emotional hook above headline
  - Current: Just "Know what's next"
  - New: "Ever realize at 11pm something's due tomorrow?" → "Never wonder what's due."

  - Current: Too many things competing
  - New: "Upload syllabi. Connect Canvas. See everything.\nDo Now. Up Next. Due Soon. Always current."
- [ ] Make trust chips more prominent
  - "6,134 schools • No IT approval • Built by a student"

**Priority 2: Remove Cringy Language**
- [ ] "AI study buddy" → "Chat with your syllabi"
- [ ] Any "synergize," "optimize," "paradigm" → remove entirely

**Priority 3: Add "Built by Student" Messaging**
- [ ] Riley's bio section: Emphasize "Still in classes, uses it every day"

- Possibly new components in `/components/`

---

### Phase 3: Visual Polish (Week 3)

3. Strengthen trust chips
4. Update Riley's bio to emphasize "still in classes"

**Impact**: Highest leverage, most visible

### Hour 2: Remove All Banned Phrases

3. Double-check "AI study buddy" → "Chat with your syllabi"

**Impact**: Prevents eye-rolls, builds trust

---

## Handoff to Developers

**When passing this to dev team:**

1. **Share These Docs**:

   - Quick Reference (for questions)

2. **Emphasize**:
   - Copy must match spec EXACTLY (not paraphrased)
   - No "improving" the copy without approval
   - Tone matters as much as information

3. **Acceptance Criteria**:
   - [ ] All copy matches Landing Page Copy Spec
   - [ ] No banned phrases present
   - [ ] Passes tone checklist
   - [ ] Riley approves final version

4. **Review Process**:
   - Dev implements → Staging preview → Riley reviews copy → Approve/revise → Ship

## Content Calendar Template

**Use this to plan messaging across channels:**

| Week | Landing Page | Email | Social | In-App |
|------|--------------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Launch hero updates | Welcome series v2 | Pain point posts | New onboarding |
| 2 | Add problem section | Feature: Syllabus upload | Demo videos | Tooltips update |
| 3 | Before/after comparison | Feature: Canvas | Testimonials | Empty states |
| 4 | Differentiation table | Re-engagement | "Built by student" | Success messages |

---

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### ❌ Mistake 1: "Let's Make It More Professional"
**Why it's bad**: "Professional" often means corporate, which loses authenticity

**Fix**: Ask "Would Riley say this to a friend?" Not "Would a Fortune 500 say this?"

### ❌ Mistake 2: Adding Features Without Context
**Why it's bad**: Feature soup overwhelms students

**Fix**: Lead with outcome ("Never miss deadlines"), THEN show mechanism

### ❌ Mistake 3: Generic Pain Points
**Why it's bad**: "Stay organized" could be any app

**Fix**: Be specific - "Sunday night panic," "11pm realization"

### ❌ Mistake 4: Forgetting Authenticity
**Why it's bad**: Loses competitive advantage

**Fix**: Every page should mention "built by a student"

### ❌ Mistake 5: Too Much at Once
**Why it's bad**: Students bounce if overwhelmed

**Fix**: Progressive disclosure - start simple, reveal depth

---

## Success Metrics

**How to know if the rebrand is working:**

### Quantitative
- ✅ Bounce rate < 40% (currently tracking?)
- ✅ Time on page > 2 minutes
- ✅ CTA click-through > 15%
- ✅ Email syllabus conversion > 10%
- ✅ Sign-up completion > 60%

### Qualitative
- ✅ Students can explain DormWay in one sentence
- ✅ "Built by student" comes up organically in feedback
- ✅ Pain points resonate ("You get me!")
- ✅ No confusion about what DormWay does
- ✅ Trust in authenticity (not corporate)

### The Ultimate Test
**Ask 10 students**: "What's DormWay?"

**Success**: They say something like:
- "Never miss deadlines - syncs all your syllabi and Canvas"
- "See what's due - built by a student"
- "AI that knows YOUR courses"

**Failure**: They say:
- "Umm... some school app?"
- "Productivity thing?"
- "Not sure, honestly"

---

## Maintenance Plan

**Brand is not set-it-and-forget-it. Maintain it:**

### Monthly
- [ ] Run brand audit checklist
- [ ] Review new copy for consistency
- [ ] Check for corporate language creep
- [ ] Update Quick Reference if we learn new phrases that work

### Quarterly
- [ ] Test positioning with new student cohort

- [ ] Update Landing Page Copy Spec if major changes

### Annually
- [ ] Full brand refresh (if needed)
- [ ] Comprehensive voice guide update
- [ ] Student comprehension study
- [ ] Competitive landscape review

## Decision Tree: When Unsure About Copy

```
Is this for students or investors?
  ├─ Students → Use Master Guide
  └─ Investors → Use Master Guide (Positioning section)

Is it conversational?
  ├─ Yes → Good
  └─ No → Would Riley say this to a friend?
         ├─ Yes → Good
         └─ No → Rewrite

Does it use banned phrases?
  ├─ Yes → STOP. Replace with approved alternative
  └─ No → Continue

Does it lead with emotion or features?
  ├─ Emotion → Good
  └─ Features → Rewrite: emotion → transformation → mechanism

Is authenticity present?
  ├─ Yes → Good
  └─ No → Add "built by a student" or Riley's story

Does it make you want to roll your eyes?
  ├─ Yes → REWRITE
  └─ No → Ship it
```

## Questions & Answers

**Q: Can I deviate from the Master Guide?**
A: Only with Riley's explicit approval. The guide exists to maintain consistency.

**Q: What if I have a new idea for messaging?**
A: Test it against the tone checklist. If it passes, propose it to Riley. If approved, update the Quick Reference.

**Q: How strict is the "banned phrases" list?**
A: Very strict. Those phrases make students roll their eyes. Don't use them.

**Q: Can I use emojis?**
A: Sparingly. Social media: yes. Landing page: minimal. In-app: only if it aids understanding (📧, ✅, ⚠️).

**Q: What if competitors start using our language?**
A: That's validation. Our authenticity (Riley's story, 6,134 schools) is the moat, not specific phrases.

**This guide is your implementation roadmap. Use it to transform the brand docs into real, consistent, conversion-driving copy across all of DormWay.**

**Questions?** Re-read the Master Guide, check the Quick Reference, or ask Riley.

**Remember**: Brand is not what you say about yourself - it's what students believe about you. Make them believe DormWay is essential, authentic, and built for them.

## What We're Looking For

### Ideal Candidate Profile

**Selection Criteria:**

1. **You've built something:** Side project, OSS contribution, hackathon thing — just proof you can ship

2. **You have an iPhone:** iOS 17+ required. Web build is live in testing and Android in the works. If you're Android-only, Labs isn't the right fit yet—join as an Ambassador instead.

3. **You care about privacy:** DormWay handles student data with a FERPA-sensitive, privacy-first mindset

4. **You can commit 5-8 hours/week:** Weekly calls + testing + sharing observations

5. **You're curious:** Want to see how DormWay actually builds, not just use the finished product

6. **Different campuses help:** Need people at MIT, Michigan, random state schools—geographic diversity matters. Online schools included.

### What We're NOT Looking For

- Android-only users (iOS required; web and Android builds in progress)
- People who just want to pad their resume without real contribution
- Candidates who can't commit the time (5-8 hours/week minimum)
- Those without technical background or evidence of building something
- Applicants who can't communicate technical issues clearly
- People looking for traditional internships (this is a learning cohort with supervised participation)

## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Issues & Mitigation Strategies

**1. Low Application Quality**
- **Mitigation:** Focus on quality over quantity—better to have 8 strong participants than 10 weak ones
- **Backup:** Direct recruit from Riley's Twitch community and known networks
- **Note:** With only 10 spots, be selective but realistic about timeline

**2. Poor Engagement/Dropout**
- **Mitigation:** Weekly check-ins with less active participants, understand blockers
- **Backup:** Accept rolling applications to backfill if someone drops before Dec 1
- **Note:** W2 employment creates stronger commitment than unpaid programs

**3. Overwhelming Bug Volume**
- **Mitigation:** Clear issue severity guidelines, automated duplicate detection
- **Strategy:** Weekly triage sessions, prioritize critical/high severity
- **Reality Check:** 300+ issues from 10 people = 30 per person = 3 per week—manageable

**4. Infrastructure Not Ready**
- **Mitigation:** Staged rollout - start with smaller group Week 1, expand if stable
- **Backup:** Delay program start by 1 week if critical issues found (but Dec 1 is tight timeline)

**5. Founder Time Constraints**
- **Mitigation:** Pre-record some content, make more async
- **Backup:** Scale back office hours frequency if necessary

## DormWay VC Talking Points - Revised

### **The Ask: $3-5M Seed Round**

**The Realization That Changes Everything:**

- **syllabus@dormway.app** - Email your syllabus, get your life organized
- Zero friction entry point for 19M college students
- Not building a U-M app - building the gmail of academic organization

**Why $3-5M:**

- Infrastructure for 10M+ emails (this could hit Week 1)
- AI compute for every syllabus format in America
- 3-5 engineers to handle viral scale
- $50K influencer seeding budget
- Runway through Series A with millions of users

---

### **The PLG Funnel That Works**

**Layer 1: EMAIL** (Viral Entry)

- "Just email syllabus@dormway.app"
- Works for ANY college in America
- 5-second explanation
- Natural screenshot/share moment

**Layer 2: WEBSITE** (Value Demo)

- Shows your beautiful organized semester
- "Add another class" → app download nudge
- Social proof: "2.3M students organized this week"

**Layer 3: APP** (Full Experience)

- Multiple syllabi, notes, materials
- Study groups, AI assistant
- Push notifications
- College+ premium features

---

### **The Influencer Math**

**Traditional Campus Marketing:**

- Street teams: $8-20 CAC
- Slow rollout school by school
- Limited by physical presence

**Our Strategy:**

- 20-30 college influencers: $20K total
- Potential reach: 2-5M students
- Cost per email: $0.50-1.00
- Natural viral coefficient from sharing

**One TikTok Example:** "POV: You just discovered syllabus@dormway.app" → 500K views → 50K emails → 10K app downloads

---

### **Why This Is THE Back-to-School Play**

**Timing:**

- August 16: U-M launch (proof point)
- August 20-Sept 5: Every college starts
- Syllabus week = our Super Bowl

**Natural Virality:**

- GroupMe/Discord shares: "Everyone send your syllabus to this"
- Parent network: "Finally my kid is organized"
- TA/Professor mentions: "Students seem more prepared"

**The Data Moat:**

- Every syllabus format from every professor
- AI learns all assignment patterns
- Becomes smarter with each email
- Impossible to replicate without scale

---

### **Riley + The 22-Year-Old Advantage**

**Still Critical Because:**

- He knows syllabus week panic is universal
- Understands which influencers matter
- Knows the GroupMe/Discord share dynamics
- Can spot fake vs authentic student content

**The Authenticity:**

- "My co-founder is literally organizing his senior year with this"
- Not corporate ed-tech - built by students
- Riley makes the TikToks that convert

---

### **Revised Growth Projections**

**Conservative:**

- 100K emails first month
- 20K app downloads
- U-M proves 75% penetration model

**Base Case:**

- 1M emails by October
- 200K app users
- 10-20K paying College+ users

**Viral Case:**

- 5M+ emails first semester
- 1M+ app users
- Category-defining moment

---

### **Unit Economics at Scale**

**Costs (all variable):**

- Email processing: $0.10/email
- Influencer CAC: $0.50-1.00
- App infrastructure: $0.65/user/month

**Revenue:**

- 5-10% convert to College+ ($4.50/month)
- Contextual ads for free users
- Aggregate data licensing

**At 1M emails:**

- 200K app users
- $100K+ MRR within 90 days
- Path to $10M ARR by Year 2

---

### **The New Close**

"We just discovered our Gmail moment. syllabus@dormway.app is going to process 10 million syllabi this September.

Any student at any college emails their syllabus and gets their entire semester organized instantly. It's the simplest tool in education. One email. Zero friction. Infinite virality.

We're not raising to build a U-M app. We're raising to handle the infrastructure when every college student in America discovers this during syllabus week. Our micro-influencer strategy costs $20K and could reach 5 million students. That's a $0.004 CPM.

Riley understands exactly how this spreads because he's watching his friends panic about fall schedules right now. By September, 'just email syllabus@dormway' will be the most shared message in college GroupMes.

We need $3-5M to build the infrastructure for what's about to happen. This isn't a slow campus-by-campus rollout. This is capturing back-to-school 2025 in one viral moment. The only question is whether you want to be part of owning the way 19 million students organize their lives."

### **The Killer Stats**

- 19M college students in US
- 100% have email
- $0.50-1.00 CAC through influencers
- 10M syllabi = unbeatable AI training data
- Email → App conversion: 20-30%
- Series A ready with 1M+ users

**The Bottom Line:** We're not pitching an app anymore. We're pitching the simplest, most viral tool in education.

# Operational Stability

The definition of what must work flawlessly for [DormWay](/docs/operations/meta/obsidian-indexes/dormway) to launch on August 16, 2025.

## Definition

A user can successfully:
1. ✅ Complete [Onboarding](/docs/product/features/onboarding/onboarding) without errors
2. ✅ Upload a syllabus (Syllabus Loading) in PDF or Word format
3. ✅ Connect their calendar ([Calendar System](/docs/product/features/calendar-system)) with correct times
4. ✅ Get accurate answers from BrainGains
5. ✅ Return daily without issues

With:
- Zero blocking errors in [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys)
- [Privacy compliance](/docs/product/features/student-experience/privacy-consent-default) (consent defaults to false)
- Sub-3-second app launch
- Sub-2-second API responses

## What It's NOT

Operational stability does NOT require:
- Every feature working perfectly
- Support for all edge cases
- Desktop/web apps
- Android support
- Features outside [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys)

## Current Blockers

1. **[Privacy Consent Default](/docs/product/features/student-experience/privacy-consent-default)** - Must default to false (currently true)
2. **Word Document Extraction** - Not implemented
3. **[Timezone Conversions](/docs/engineering/technical/data-and-time/timezone-conversions)** - Bugs in EST/UTC/PST handling
4. **[Event Lifecycle](/docs/engineering/technical/calendar/calendar-event-removal-and-lifecycle-management)** - Soft deletion not implemented

## Metrics

- **Onboarding**: 95%+ completion rate
- **Syllabus Upload**: `&lt;3 min` processing time
- **Calendar Sync**: Zero timezone errors
- **BrainGains**: `&lt;2 sec` response time
- **Crashes**: `&lt;0.1%` crash rate

## Testing Strategy

Each of the [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys) must be tested:
- Happy path (everything works)
- Common errors (network, permissions)
- Recovery flows (retry, fallback)
- Performance under load

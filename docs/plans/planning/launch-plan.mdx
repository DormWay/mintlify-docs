# Launch Plan

**Target Date**: August 16, 2025 (36 days remaining)

The launch plan for [DormWay](/docs/operations/meta/obsidian-indexes/dormway) centers on achieving [Operational Stability](/docs/plans/planning/operational-stability) for our [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys).

## Timeline

- **July 11, 2025**: Snap the Line - Freeze feature scope
- **July 12-31**: Stabilize core features
- **August 1-10**: Final testing and polish
- **August 11-15**: Launch preparation
- **August 16**: 🚀 Launch at University of Michigan

## Critical Path

1. Fix [Privacy Consent Default](/docs/product/features/student-experience/privacy-consent-default) - Currently blocking [Onboarding](/docs/product/features/onboarding/onboarding)
2. Implement Word Document Extraction - Expands Syllabus Loading
3. Fix [Timezone Conversions](/docs/engineering/technical/data-and-time/timezone-conversions) - Critical for [Calendar System](/docs/product/features/calendar-system)
4. Ensure BrainGains stability with all document types

## Success Metrics

- All [5 Core User Journeys](/docs/plans/planning/5-core-user-journeys) work flawlessly
- Zero blocking bugs in [Onboarding](/docs/product/features/onboarding/onboarding)
- Syllabus Loading supports PDF and Word

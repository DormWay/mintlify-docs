# Student Growth Fellow - Lauran & Alex JD

**Tags:** #growth #campus-strategy #greek-life #influencer-marketing #scale
**Created:** 2025-11-13
**Status:** Active
**Team Members:** Lauran, Alex
**Reports To:** Riley Crimmins (CEO)
**Launch Timeline:** January 2026 (Spring Semester)
**Scope:** Multi-Campus National Launch

## Overview

Student Growth Fellows are **scalable growth strategists and content creators** who drive DormWay adoption across hundreds of campuses simultaneously through viral content, remote ambassador networks, Greek Life partnerships, and data-driven growth tactics during the **Spring Semester launch**. This is a high-leverage role combining content strategy (blogs, TikTok, Instagram), campus network orchestration, influencer marketing at scale, and the "Holy Shit" PLG framework to create transformative moments that make students say: **"How did I live without this?"**

**Launch Context:** January capitalizes on "New Year, New Semester" fresh start psychology when students returning from winter break are most receptive to organizational tools. We're launching **nationwide across all active campuses simultaneously**, not one campus at a time.

**Strategic Imperative:** Build repeatable, scalable playbooks that work across diverse campus types (large state schools, small liberal arts, community colleges) without requiring physical presence at each location.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Scalable Campus Ambassador Network Development

**Why It Matters:** We need 1,000+ campus ambassadors activated simultaneously across hundreds of campuses to create critical mass.

**Key Activities:**
- **Ambassador Recruitment Automation**:
  - Build recruitment funnels targeting student organizations
  - Create self-serve onboarding with training videos
  - Develop tiered ambassador program (Pioneer → Active → Community)
  - Target: 5-10 ambassadors per priority campus (500+ campuses)

- **Ambassador Enablement at Scale**:
  - Create comprehensive digital toolkit (videos, graphics, scripts)
  - Build ambassador Slack/Discord for peer support
  - Develop gamified leaderboard system
  - Weekly virtual office hours and training calls

- **Incentive Structure**:
  - Performance-based compensation tied to campus adoption
  - Recognition tiers (badges, exclusive access, founder calls)
  - Monthly leaderboards with rewards
  - Equity consideration for top performers

**Success Metrics:**
- Number of active ambassadors (target: 1,000+)
- Ambassadors activated per campus (target: 5-10)
- Ambassador-driven referrals as % of total signups
- Ambassador retention month-over-month

### 2. Greek Life as Growth Multiplier (Lauran & Alex's Key Insight)

**Why It Matters:** Greek Life represents concentrated networks with built-in viral loops. When one house adopts, rival houses follow due to FOMO and competitive dynamics.

**Strategic Approach - Scalable Model:**

- **Remote Greek Life Partnership Playbook**:
  - Identify Greek Life coordinators at each campus (public directories)
  - Build email outreach sequence for chapter presidents
  - Create Greek Life-specific pitch deck and demo
  - "Chapter Adoption Challenge" framework that works at any school

- **Competitive Dynamics Framework**:
  - Track adoption by house and display on campus dashboards
  - Create house-vs-house leaderboards
  - Social proof messaging: "Kappa Kappa Gamma has 92% adoption"
  - Exclusive Greek Life features/badges in app

- **Rush/Recruitment Integration** (January = Spring Rush):
  - Position DormWay in new member orientation
  - "Get organized from day one" messaging for pledges
  - Work with Greek Life councils to recommend DormWay
  - Create exclusive "Greek Member" onboarding flow

**Scalable Execution:**
- Build database of Greek Life contacts (presidents, coordinators)
- Create automated email sequences with personalization tokens
- Develop case studies from early-adopting chapters
- Host virtual Greek Life demo days (Zoom webinars)

**Success Metrics:**
- Greek chapters partnered per campus
- Greek member signups as % of total campus
- Viral coefficient within Greek networks
- House-to-house adoption spread rate

### 3. Data-Driven "Holy Shit" Moment Engineering

## Key Strategic Insights from Lauran & Alex

### Greek Life as Growth Multiplier
- Greek Life = concentrated networks with natural viral dynamics
- Spring rush/recruitment = critical adoption windows (January-February)
- House competition drives FOMO and mass adoption
- Social proof within houses creates inevitability
- One house adopts → rival houses must follow

### Scalability Through Remote Orchestration
- Can't be physically present at 500+ campuses simultaneously
- Build self-serve systems and playbooks
- Empower local ambassadors as force multipliers
- Use data to identify what works, scale what works
- Weekly virtual touchpoints vs constant in-person presence

### Infrastructure vs. App Positioning
- Don't ask "Should you download this app?"
- Ask "How do you get organized for spring semester?"
- Bundle with essential services messaging (Canvas, email, syllabus)
- Make DormWay feel like campus-provided utility
- "Everyone uses it" social proof is critical

### Content as Growth Engine
- Student-relatable content drives organic discovery and sharing
- Viral social content (TikTok/Instagram) creates top-of-funnel awareness
- Blog content drives SEO, establishes authority, converts searches
- User-generated content provides social proof and authenticity
- Consistency matters more than perfection - ship fast, iterate
- Content should always lead back to "Holy Shit" moments

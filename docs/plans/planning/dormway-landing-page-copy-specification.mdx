### 6. Differentiation (Why DormWay vs Others)

**Goal**: Position against alternatives students already use

**Layout**: Comparison table + narrative

**Copy**:

```
[Headline]
Why not just use...?

[Subheadline]
Good question. Here's what makes DormWay different:

[Comparison Table]

| What You Might Try | The Problem | DormWay's Difference |
|-------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Canvas alone** | No cross-class view. No intelligence. Just a repository. | See ALL classes. AI spots conflicts. Grade calculator. |
| **Google Calendar + manual entry** | You forget to add things. Takes forever. Never updates. | Auto-syncs from Canvas + syllabi. Updates itself. |
| **ChatGPT for questions** | Doesn't know YOUR courses. Generic answers. | Knows YOUR syllabi. Specific to YOUR classes. |
| **Notion or other planners** | You have to build it. Requires discipline. Abandoned in 2 weeks. | Pre-built for students. Updates itself. You'll actually use it. |
| **Just toughing it out** | Sunday night panic. Forgotten deadlines. Stress. | Peace of mind. Know what's next. Sleep well. |

[Bottom Line - Key Differentiators]

✓ Works at 6,134 schools (no IT approval)
✓ AI knows YOUR syllabi (not generic)
✓ Updates itself (no manual entry)
✓ One place for everything (stop app-hopping)
✓ Built by someone who needed it (authenticity)

Still in classes. Built this because I needed it to survive my own coursework.

I use DormWay every single day.

Veteran Engineer

Knows how to build at scale.

Keeps the system running for 6,134 schools. Makes sure it's fast, reliable, and actually works when you need it.

## Mobile Considerations

### Breakpoints

```css
/* Mobile */
@media (max-width: 640px) {
  /* Single column layout */
  /* Larger touch targets (min 44px) */
  /* Reduce font sizes by 20% */
}

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 641px) and (max-width: 1024px) {
  /* Two-column layout where appropriate */
}

/* Desktop */
@media (min-width: 1025px) {
  /* Full layout as specified */
}
```

### Mobile-Specific Changes

1. **Hero**:
   - Stack elements vertically
   - Reduce headline size (2.5rem instead of 3.5rem)
   - Full-width CTA buttons

2. **Problem Section**:
   - Single column
   - Animated list (items appear on scroll)

3. **How It Works**:
   - Horizontal scroll cards
   - Swipe indicators

4. **Comparison Table**:
   - Accordion-style instead of table
   - Tap to expand each row

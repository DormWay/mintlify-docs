# LockedIn Settings UX Remediation Plan

## Purpose
Document the current issues in the Settings page and define a clear UX/UI plan for a student-friendly, scannable, and consistent settings experience that matches DormWay visual language and real feature support.

This plan complements:
- `obsidian-vault/DormWay/Engineering/Architecture/LockedIn Settings & Preferences Spec (Web).md`

## Scope
- LockedIn web app Settings page (accordion + sections).
- Visual system alignment with the rest of the dashboard.
- Behavior and interaction model (autosave vs manual save).
- Feature gating and the removal of controls that do not affect behavior.

## Observed Issues (From Current Screens)
### Global layout and hierarchy
- Collapsed sections waste horizontal space; the layout feels tall and empty.
- Excessive vertical padding between sections reduces scannability.
- Subtext is always visible, adding cognitive load and crowding.
- Collapsed rows do not show status or current values, so the list is not useful for scanning.
- Hover-only explanations do not work on mobile; touch users get no clarity.
- All sections have equal visual weight; priority settings do not stand out.
- There is no "quick control" zone for high-frequency actions.
- Inconsistent visual density and spacing across sections.
- Section headers and contents do not establish a clear reading order.

### Account section
- Clerk embed still feels visually distinct (tone, surface, borders).
- The account area feels like a "different app" inside Settings.

### Connections section
- Layout uses long horizontal rows with little information density.
- Users must scan edge-to-edge for the action button.
- The design underuses the available width.
- Connection status and last sync are hidden until expanded.

### Notifications and Focus
- The layout is dense and confusing; poor grouping and scanning.
- Users cannot quickly parse the primary settings.
- Too many controls and text blocks compete for attention.

### DayPlan and Briefings
- Same hierarchy issues as Notifications.
- Unclear relationships between toggles and outcomes.
- Manual Save per section feels inconsistent and slow.

### Calendar and Schedule
- Text-heavy and flat with no visual grouping.
- Users do not know where to look next.
- Controls are not clearly separated into clusters.

### Appearance
- Layout lacks alignment and consistent structure.
- Mixed horizontal and vertical grouping feels unintentional.
- A lot of empty space with weak emphasis on key controls.

### AI and Ace
- Missing a reliable global on/off gate.
- Tone and personality controls appear but are not meaningful yet.
- Coming soon toggles still create false affordance.

### Privacy and Data
- Toggle associations are unclear.
- Layout lacks grouping and visual hierarchy.

### Widgets and Personalization
- Similar hierarchy and grouping issues.
- "Coming soon" controls still feel too active.

### Support
- Acceptable compared to other sections; least problematic.

## UX Objectives
- Make settings scannable in under 10 seconds on first pass.
- Reduce cognitive load by grouping into a few clear clusters.
- Show only controls that actually impact product behavior.
- Use consistent spacing, density, and card language.
- Support quick skimming with short labels and summary chips.
- Provide a "quick control" row for the 3-4 most-used settings.
- Make the collapsed list useful on its own (status, key values, and state).

## Proposed Interaction Model
### Quick controls
- Add a small row above the accordion with 3-4 fast toggles.
- Suggested: Quiet Hours, Theme, Timezone, AI On/Off.
- Keep it compact; remove if it causes clutter on mobile.

### Accordion behavior
- Collapsed state: show icon + title + summary chips + a status pill.
- Subtitle appears on hover/focus on desktop; on touch, show a one-line summary.
- Expanded state: show content grouped into 2 to 3 cards per section.

### Autosave
- Default to autosave with a 600-900ms debounce on change.
- Inline status: "Saving..." then "Saved" near section header.
- Use manual Save only where changes are destructive or multi-step.

### Feature gating
- If a control does not change behavior, hide it.
- If it must exist for roadmap context, show a disabled group with:
  - "Coming soon" label and a single explanation line.
  - No toggles that look active or clickable.

## Layout Framework (Use Across Sections)
### Global spacing
- Reduce section gap to a tighter stack (10-14px).
- Reduce inner padding for collapsed sections.

### Section structure
1. Section header row (icon, title, summary chips, status pill, expand chevron).
2. Expanded body with a 2-column grid on desktop:
   - Left column: primary settings (most used).
   - Right column: secondary or advanced settings.
3. Each cluster uses a compact card with a title, short description, and controls.

### Summary chips (collapsed)
Examples:
- Notifications: "Chill", "Quiet 10pm-7am", "Push On"
- DayPlan: "Focused", "Briefings On"
- Calendar: "Campus TZ", "Week starts Sun"
- Appearance: "Dark", "Medium", "Amber"

## Section-by-Section Redesign Plan
### 1) Account
- Wrap Clerk profile in a DormWay card container with a neutral header.
- Match backgrounds to `--ds-surface-2` and soften edges.

### 2) Connections
- Use a 2x2 card grid instead of long rows.
- Each card includes:
  - Icon + name + short purpose
  - Status pill (Connected, Not connected)
  - Primary action button aligned bottom-right

### 3) Notifications and Focus (full redesign)
- Split into 3 clusters:
  1. Focus mode (Chill / Balanced / Locked-In)
  2. Quiet hours and delivery channels
  3. Briefing cadence and caps
- Use a left-to-right flow and reduce text to short labels.
- Emphasize the preset selection at top as the primary control.

### 4) DayPlan and Briefings
- Split into:
  - Briefings (on/off + morning/evening time)
  - DayPlan detail level (Minimal / Focused / Coach)
  - Extras (suggestions, coming up, wellness)
- Use a 2-column grid for times + toggles.

### 5) Calendar and Schedule
- Cluster controls by outcome:
  - Timezone and labels
  - Display defaults (format, week start, default view)
  - Work hours
- Use card groups with visible headings and short subtext.

### 6) Appearance
- Align into a 2-column grid:
  - Left: theme, font size, accent
  - Right: preview and course colors
- Use consistent card widths and aligned labels.

### 7) AI and Ace
- Add a master toggle: AI On/Off.
- If Off: hide all AI tone/personality content.
- For now: remove tone/personality/helpfulness controls entirely.
- Keep only the AI On/Off toggle until those features are real.

### 8) Privacy and Data
- Group into:
  - Analytics and data sharing
  - Location and visibility
- Use a two-column layout with clear labels and helper text.

### 9) Widgets and Personalization
- Separate:
  - Home editor link (primary action)
  - Insight preferences (future)
  - Layout learning (future)
- If future only, show a single disabled card with explanation.

### 10) Support
- Minor polish only (spacing and card alignment).

## Implementation Phases
### Phase 1: Visual and layout system
- Reduce vertical spacing and header density.
- Add summary chips + status pills to collapsed rows.
- Add quick controls row at the top.
- Standardize card sizes and grid layout.
- Add visual weight hierarchy (top 3 sections more prominent).

### Phase 2: Core reflows
- Rebuild Notifications and DayPlan sections.
- Rebuild Calendar and Appearance sections.
- Introduce autosave behavior + inline status.

### Phase 3: Feature gating and cleanup
- Remove non-functional toggles.
- Gate AI controls behind AI master toggle.
- Replace "coming soon" toggles with disabled group cards.

## Open Questions
- Do we want per-section autosave or global autosave?
- Should summary chips be editable (quick actions) or read-only?
- For AI, should we keep any personalization controls visible right now?
- Should we provide an "Expand all / Collapse all" toggle for power users?

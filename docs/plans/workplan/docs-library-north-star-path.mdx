# Docs Library North Star Path

This plan defines the north star experience for Docs (Library) and the code edits needed to get there from the current LockedIn implementation.

---

## North Star UX (Student Outcomes)
- Find a file in under 10 seconds.
- Start a doc-linked note in under 2 interactions.
- Continue studying from where they left off without hunting.
- Docs and Notes are one surface, not two destinations.

---

## North Star IA
- Default landing: **Overview** (Continue Studying + Recent docs + Recent notes + Inbox).
- **Files** tab: list + filters + doc inspector.
- **Notes** tab: list + editor, filtered by course.
- **Search** tab: unified docs + notes query.
- **Study View**: doc viewer + notes panel (default on doc click).

---

## Two-Click Access (from Home)
- Home -> Docs -> Overview: continue doc + note.
- Home -> Docs -> Notes tab: notes list + editor.
- Home -> Courses -> Materials: course-filtered Docs.
- Home -> Schedule/Tasks -> Open class notes: notes editor prefilled.

---

## Current State (Snapshot)
- `/dashboard/documents` = list + summary preview.
- `/dashboard/notes-hub` = Notes Hub editor.
- Doc-linked notes metadata now supported via `/notes/sync` (`noteType`, `linkedDocIds`).
- Study View exists as an overlay, but is not default.

---

## Gap List
1) No Overview landing (no Continue Studying or Inbox).
2) Doc click does not open Study View by default.
3) Notes are not surfaced as doc-linked context on the list view.
4) Search is not unified across docs + notes.
5) No backend query for notes by doc id.

---

## Implementation Plan (Phased)

### Phase 0 - Routing + Metadata (Done / In Flight)
- Docs deep link uses `?documentId=`.
- Notes metadata includes `noteType` and `linkedDocIds`.
- Notes deep links route to `/dashboard/notes-hub` and preserve params.

Code touchpoints:
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/notes-hub/page.tsx`
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/lib/notes-sync.ts`
- `services/api-router/src/routes/notes-sync-routes.ts`

### Phase 1 - Make Study View Default
Goal: clicking a doc opens Study View (viewer + notes panel).

Code changes:
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`
  - Default click target -> Study View.
  - Keep list visible via a collapsible rail.
  - Move summary into a tab or collapsible panel inside Study View.
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/components/docs/DocumentNotesPanel.tsx`
  - Tighten linked notes list and create note CTA.

### Phase 2 - Overview Landing
Goal: `/dashboard/documents` lands on Overview (Continue, Recent, Inbox).

Code changes:
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`
  - Add Overview section with cards:
    - Continue Studying (last opened doc + linked note).
    - Recent docs (top 6-10).
    - Recent notes (top 6-10).
    - Inbox (untagged docs).
- Add simple state that switches between Overview and Files/Notes/Search.

### Phase 3 - Unified Search
Goal: one search box for docs + notes with filters.

Code changes:
- `services/dormway-lockedin/src/app/dashboard/documents/page.tsx`
  - Add Search tab that queries docs + notes.
- `services/api-router/src/routes/notes-sync-routes.ts`
  - Add `GET /notes/search` or use existing search with filtering.

### Phase 4 - Polishing + Quality
Goal: finish the release-ready experience.

Code changes:
- Add analytics events (`doc_opened`, `doc_note_created`, `doc_notes_panel_opened`).
- Tighten empty states and course tagging flows.
- Add "Resume" CTA to Overview that opens Study View.

---

## Backend + Data Work
Preferred API change:
- `GET /notes/by-doc?documentId=...` returns notes with `linkedDocIds` containing the doc.

Fallback (temporary):
- Add `documentId` filter to `/notes/recent` and filter server-side.

---

## Acceptance Criteria (Release Gate)
- Doc click opens Study View (viewer + notes) by default.
- Overview shows Continue + Recent docs + Recent notes.
- A student can resume a doc-linked note in 2 interactions from Home.
- Unified search finds docs + notes quickly.

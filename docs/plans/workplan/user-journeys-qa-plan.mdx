# User Journeys QA Plan

Comprehensive test plan across core flows. Prefer dry runs where supported before writing.

## 1) PLG Entry & Ensure User
- Trigger PLG capture (email entry or syllabus email).
- Admin: PLG Spot Check → filter by domain/user.
- Run “Preview Fix (dry run)” then “Fix Filtered Users”.
- Verify: single student context, campus link set (provisional if expected).

## 2) Sign Up (Full Registration)
- Complete auth flow.
- Verify: account exists, no duplicate student contexts.

## 3) Schedule Upload
- Upload ICS (mobile/app).
- Verify: events imported, calendar prefs present, duplicates avoided.

## 4) Syllabus Upload
- Upload PDF → processing pipeline.
- Admin: Syllabus Campus Linker → find syllabus, preview JSON, open PDF.
- Verify: derived course code/title, course context created or reused, campus link correct.

## 5) Term Processing
- Verify term detection and course roll-up.
- Confirm course contexts under campus are consistent; no duplicates by code.

## 6) Notes
- Add/edit notes for syllabus/course/user.
- Verify persistence and retrieval in UI.

## 7) Term Reprocessing
- Re-run processing → idempotent updates (no duplicate courses/links).
- Use PLG dry-run where applicable before applying changes.

## Reporting
- Capture screenshots for UI changes.
- Record counts from dry runs and actual runs.
- Log any anomalies with user id, syllabus id, course id, campus id.
